  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>As I have been requested to write a preface to <cite>The History
of Sarawak under its Two White Rajahs</cite>, one of whom I
have the honour to be, I must, first of all, assert that I
have had nothing to do with the composition or writing of
the book, and I do not profess to be a writer, otherwise
than in a very ordinary sense, having left school at the age
of twelve to enter the Navy.</p>

<p class='c000'>In that service I remained for ten years, when I obtained
my lieutenancy, and then received two years' leave, which
the Admiralty were glad to grant at that time (about 1852),
as they thought naval officers were of a type likely to be
of service in the development of the colonies and the
improvement of native states. I then went to Sarawak to
join my uncle, the first Rajah, with and under whom I
remained, and consequently had to retire from the Navy;
but I will admit that my ten years' service gave me what I
probably could not have gained from any other profession—the
advantages of having been taught to obey my seniors,
and of having been disciplined; and I very firmly adhere
to the rule that no one can make a successful commander
unless he has learnt to obey. It further taught me those
seafaring qualities, which have been so useful ever since, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>being able to rough it and put up with one's surroundings,
the lack of which so often makes the men of the present
day, in their refined and gentlemanly way, not quite suited
to handle the wheel of a ship at sea or the plough on land.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now I will pass on to say how this book, good or bad
as it may be—and I am not competent to pass judgment
either way—came to be written. I was asked by more than
one if I had any objection to the writing of my biography,
and I, as far as I can recollect, gave no decided answer one
way or the other; but I thought if I handed over the
correspondence and all records that related to Sarawak and
its Government that the distinguished author, Baring-Gould,
and my friend, Charles Bampfylde, might be enabled to
form a truthful account, and at the same time give the
public a readable book.</p>

<p class='c000'>I thought that some interest might be felt in the story
of a life such as mine has been for the last sixty years,
coupled with an account of the institutions, manners, and
customs of the inhabitants of Sarawak, and especially of the
way in which we have always treated the native population,
finding much profit by it, more in kindliness and sympathy
than in a worldly point of view, by making them our
friends, and I may say associates, though they are of a
different creed and different colour; and how we gained
their hearts by living among them and really knowing them,
not as superiors, but as equals and friends; and I thought
being brought out during my life by the pen of the able
author and that of my old and much-esteemed officer, Mr.
Bampfylde, it would be more likely to give a correct impression
than if some one took up the pen after my death and
gained material from some good and some rather scratchy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>works that have been written on Sarawak, since such an one
would probably make up a work that would be, no doubt,
very readable and well adapted to take the fashion of the
day, but not so truthful as a man of long personal experience
could do, and has, I think, done it; and this I can
aver, that what is written are facts, however plain and
uninteresting they may prove. The work is not the history
of my life more than that of the late Rajah, and I may
flatter myself that we—he as founder and myself as builder
of the state—have been one in our policy throughout, from
the beginning up to the present time; and now shortly I
have to hand it to my son, and I hope that his policy may
not be far removed from that of his predecessors.</p>

<p class='c000'>My life draws towards its close, but the book, if and
whenever brought out, will stand in the future as a record
of events that may be considered as the work of private
individuals who stood alone and unprotected in a far distant
land, and who were, I may also say, fortunately, scarcely
ever interfered with, or the policy of Sarawak could not
have been as successful as it has proved. It will, I have
reason to believe, attract more attention in comparatively
new countries, such as America and Australia, where the
story of Sarawak is perhaps better known than in England.
One word more, and that is, that the native element has
always been our base and strong point: and our lives are
safe with them so long as they are wisely treated and relied
on with thorough trust and confidence.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>TITLES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Sultan.</span>—Supreme head of the once large Bruni Sultanate, which is
now only a corner or enclave within the raj of Sarawak. Iang
di Pertuan, the Lord who Rules, is the correct supreme title in
Bruni, and the one most generally in use.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Sultan Muda</span>, heir-apparent. Lit. young Sultan, but seldom used.
Iang di Pertuan Muda is the more correct Malay title. Cp.
Pangiran, <em>infra</em>.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Rajah</span> (fem. Rani, or Ranee).—The old title of the Bruni sovereigns.
It is a Sanskrit word, and means king. But in Bruni it was
improperly assumed by those (male and female) of royal descent.
This has fallen into disuse, that is, none of them now bears such
a title, but in referring to the princes of Bruni generally the term
Rajah Rajah<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a> would be used. Rulers of districts were never
entitled to the title <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex officio</span></i>. Such rulers are feudal chiefs
with the title of Pangiran, and their chieftainship is generally
hereditary.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Rajah Muda</span>, heir apparent. Lit. young Rajah.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pangiran</span> is the highest Bruni title. Pangiran Muda—sometimes
Pangiran Muda Besar—is another title of the heir-apparent to
the Sultanate. (Rajah Muda is only used in Sarawak.) It is
a Javanese title and means prince. It is not, however, now confined
only to persons of royal descent as formerly, and the title
has become very common, especially as illegitimate as well as
legitimate children of all pangirans assume it.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Datu.</span>—Lit. great-grandfather (by extension—ancestor). This is a
high title in the Malay Peninsula, and the highest in Sarawak,
but not in Bruni, though it is in Sulu. It can be conferred by
the Ruler alone, and is an official title and not hereditary. It
is only granted to Malays.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c011'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span><span class='sc'>Bandar</span> (Persian).—The meaning of this word is a port. Datu Bandar,
one of the highest titles in Sarawak, would mean the chief of
the port or town.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Shah Bandar</span> means the Controller of the Customs.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bandahara</span> (Sanskrit.).—A treasurer. The Pangiran Bandahara is the
chief of the four Wazirs of Bruni. The present Bandahara is
Regent of Bruni.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Temanggong.</span>—Another high official title, meaning Commander-in-Chief.
The Pangiran Temanggong is one of the Bruni Wazirs.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Di Gadong and Pemancha.</span>—Also high official titles, the meanings of
which are uncertain. The Pangiran di Gadong and the Pangiran
Pemancha are the titles of the other two Bruni Wazirs.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Patinggi</span> (from Tinggi—elevated, exalted; hence Maha-tinggi, the
most high). The Datu Patinggi was the highest or premier
chief in Sarawak.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Penglima.</span>—A Malay title, also sometimes formerly given to Dayaks;
means a Commander.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Orang kaya.</span>—Lit. rich man. A title generally given to Malay chiefs
of inferior rank and to the Dayak chiefs.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Sherif.</span><a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c011'><sup>[5]</sup></a>—An Arab title meaning noble. A title assumed by half-bred
Arabs claiming descent from Muhammad. These men also take
the exalted Malay title of Tunku or Tungku<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c011'><sup>[6]</sup></a> by which princes
of the royal blood are alone addressed, but more especially the
Sultan.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Haji.</span>—One who has made the pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Tuan.</span>—Master, Sir, Lord, Mistress, Lady. Tuan Besar—High Lord.
Tuan Muda—Young Lord.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Nakoda.</span>—Shipmaster, merchant.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pengulu.</span>—Headman. A title given to Dayak district chiefs.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inchi.</span>—Mister—a lower title than Tuan. A title foreign to Sarawak,
and in that country only assumed by foreign Malays.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span><span class='sc'>Abang.</span>—Lit. elder brother. Datu's sons are styled Abang, and also
Malay Government chiefs below the rank of Datu.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Laksamana.</span>—An Admiral.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Imaum.</span>—High Priest.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Hakim.</span>—A Judge: lit. a learned man.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Awang.</span>—A title sometimes given to the sons of Pangirans.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dayang or Dang.</span>—Lady of rank. A title given to daughters of
Datus and Abangs.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Wan.</span>—Another title given to Sherifs, but more generally to their sons.
It is probably derived from the Arabic word Awan, meaning a
helper or sustainer of Muhammad.</p>

<p class='c006'>Next to Australia
and New
Guinea, Borneo<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c011'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
is the largest
island in the
world; it is
larger than the whole
of France. It sits astride
on the equator,
that divides it nearly,
but not wholly, in
two; the larger portion
being to the
north of the Line.</p>

<p class='c000'>The belt of islands, Sumatra, Java, and the chain to
Timor and the Sarwatty group, represents a line of weakness
in the crust of the earth, due to volcanic action, which still
makes itself felt there. But the axis of elevation of Borneo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>is almost at right angles to this line, and in it are no active
vents, and if there be extinct volcanoes, these are in the
extreme north only. In Sarawak there are several hot
springs, the water of which is impregnated with sulphuretted
hydrogen. The island owes its origin, as far as we can
judge, to a great upheaval of plutonic rock that has lifted
aloft and shivered the overlying beds, but the granite does
not come everywhere to the surface. Something analogous
may be seen in Exmoor, where the superincumbent clay-slate
has been heaved up and strained, but the granite nowhere
shows save in Lundy Isle, where the superposed
strata have been swept away, leaving the granite exposed.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Borneo is about 850 miles in length and 600 in
breadth, and contains an area of 286,000 square miles.
The centre of Borneo is occupied by broken hilly highland,
with isolated mountains, of which the finest is the granite
peak of Kina Balu (13,700 feet). Hills come down in
places to the sea, as in the south of Sarawak, where they
attain a height of from 2000 to over 5000 feet, and die
into the sea at Cape Datu. The plains, chiefly swamps,
are composed of the wash of the mountains, overlaid by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>vegetable mould, and these fringe the coast, extending
inland from ten to thirty miles, with here and there isolated
humps of hill standing up out of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The island is probably the best watered in the world.
On every side are numerous rivers, mainly rising in the
central highlands, at first dancing down the mountain ledges
in cascades, then, forming dangerous rapids, enter the plain,
and there swelled by affluents and widening out advance
with no strong current to the sea. Owing to the width of
the river-mouths, and to the configuration of the coast,
some of them, as the Batang Lupar, the Sadong, and Saribas,
have tidal bores, as is the case with our River Severn, that
run up as many as seventy miles into the interior, and most
have deposited troublesome bars at their mouths, and have
embouchures clogged by shoals. To the slight fall is largely
due the remarkable way in which several of these rivers
descend into the ocean through plural mouths, thus
forming a network of lateral waterways, called Loba and
Trusan, whereby they mix and mingle with other rivers,
and, very much like the Rhine after entering Holland, lose
their identity and are frittered away in many channels. The
Rejang, for instance, finds issue through five mouths, and the
land between the Rejang and Igan entrances, which meet at
Sibu, the apex of the delta, is a vast unbroken swamp, 1200
square miles in area. The same phenomenon is noticed in
the Sarawak river, and in the Limbang to a smaller degree.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rainfall in Borneo is so great, the rainy season
lasting from October to April,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c011'><sup>[8]</sup></a> that the rivers are very
numerous and copious, rolling down large volumes of water.
Severe droughts are, however, not uncommon during the
fine season of the S.W. monsoon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between Kuching and Bruni are the Sadong, Batang
Lupar, Saribas, Kalaka, Rejang, Bintulu, and the Baram
rivers, all available as waterways for trade with the interior.
For fifteen miles only from its mouth is the Batang Lupar
navigable by steamers, above that, though a fine broad
river, it is obstructed by dangerous shoals. The Rejang
is navigable by steamers for 170 miles, nearly as far as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>the first rapids. This noble river descends many stages
by as many plunges from terraces. Between the rapids the
river is deep, sluggish and broad for many miles. Boats
that can be hauled up past the rapids can ascend a distance
of 650 miles from the mouth. The Baram river is navigable
by steamers for some twenty miles above Claude Town, that
is, eighty miles from the mouth, but owing to the exposed
position of the bar and to the heavy seas breaking over it, and
also to the silting up of the mouth during the N.E. monsoon,
only very small craft can then enter, but during the S.W.
monsoon it can be entered by steamers of light draught.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Dutch Borneo as well there are magnificent rivers.
The same cause that has made some of the rivers so uncertain
in their mouths has produced vast stretches of morass,
overgrown with the nipah palm and mangrove, and infested
with mosquito swarms; but the beach is almost everywhere
of beautiful white sand, reaching to where the graceful
casuarina tree grows as a belt above the reach of the tide.
The tropical heat, added to the great rainfall, makes Borneo
a vegetable paradise; indeed, it presents the appearance of
one vast surface of sombre evergreen forest, starred with
flowering orchids, and wreathed with creepers, of a richness
perhaps unsurpassed even in South America.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hills and ranges of upland consist of blue metamorphic
limestone on which is superposed a thick series of
sandstones, conglomerates, and clay-shales. Piercing these
beds are granite and a variety of plutonic rocks, as diorite,
porphyrite, etc. These latter are developed in greatest
abundance in the antimony districts, where they are in
immediate contact with the limestone that has been fissured
and tortured by upheaval. The sandstone shales have also
been tilted and distorted; nevertheless in places they retain
their original horizontal position. They are usually found
to be impregnated with peroxide of iron. It is in this
formation that the cinnabar deposits occur.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both lime and sandstone have been extensively denuded,
and the latter rises in isolated tabular mountains, or short
peaky trends, to an altitude occasionally of 1500 feet above
the sea, the ridges separated by undulating valleys, in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>the limestone comes to the surface. Sometimes these
denuded masses form low hilly tracts varying in elevation
from 200 feet to 1200 feet; sometimes they appear as
solitary crags, but invariably present long lines of ancient sea-cliff,
and bold scarped faces, fissured and jointed in every
conceivable direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the intervening lowlands is a deposit of dark yellow
felspathic clay varying in depth from a few feet to eighty
feet and more, derived from the degradation of the hills by
water. Associated with this clay and of more recent date
are superficial deposits of pudding-stone and river gravels.
The intrusive igneous rocks show mainly in the form of
dykes, seaming the stratified rocks; consequently volcanic
action took place subsequent to their deposition, but it was
also antecedent to the more recent of the superficial deposits.
It is in immediate connection with those plutonic dykes that
we find the deposits of arsenic and cinnabar, occupying the
fissures produced in the stratified rocks by volcanic upheavals,
and we are led to the conclusion that these mineral lodes
were deposited after the cessation of the upheaval.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gold occurs in the form of fine sand in the alluvial
deposits, and in the gravel of the rivers over a great part of
Sarawak; and also in pockets of the limestone, in which it
has been allowed to fall by water. Nuggets are of extremely
rare occurrence, but Sir Spencer St. John mentions
having seen one of seven ounces taken from the auriferous
clay at Krian near Bau. The gold dust is usually in a state of
finest comminution. So far no gold reef has been come upon.</p>

<p class='c000'>In former days gold was extensively washed by Chinese
at Bau and Paku in Upper Sarawak, which auriferous
district commences at the confluence of the two branches
of the Sarawak river, and extends back to their sources and
the boundary of Dutch Borneo. As gold and antimony
were known to abound here, the Chinese of Sambas and the
lower Kapuas had made several endeavours to establish
themselves in the district, but were much harassed by the
Malays until the accession of the late Rajah Brooke,
which made it possible for them to settle there and pursue
in peace their business of gold mining. Then gold was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>washed extensively, and the fine reservoirs and "leats"
which the Chinese constructed to sluice the alluvial soil
remain to this day. They increased and became a thriving
community, but they were not sufficiently looked after, and,
falling under the machinations of socialistic Secret Societies,
gradually got out of hand and broke into open rebellion
in 1857, as shall be related in the sequel. It is sufficient
to say here that this ended in dire ruin to themselves, and
that the few who escaped were driven over the borders; but
it also ruined the gold-mining industry, and, though some of
the rebels returned and others came with them, the industry
never fully recovered, and later on it received a further
check by the introduction of pepper planting, which gave
the Chinese a more profitable occupation, and gradually
Upper Sarawak became covered with gardens of this description.
Though gold mining under the Chinese practically
died out, modern scientific and engineering skill has now
placed it in a far higher position than it had ever previously
attained, or could have attained under the primitive methods
of the previous workers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quicksilver was discovered <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</span></i> about the year 1871,
by Messrs. Helms and Walters of the Borneo Company,
who prospected over the whole of Sarawak Proper, and
ultimately succeeded in tracking the small fragments of
cinnabar that are scattered over the district to a hill on the
right bank of the Staat river. The hill is called Tegora,
and rises to an elevation of 800 feet. In the upper portion
of this hill, the ore was found deposited capriciously in strains
and pockets with here and there a little metallic mercury.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c011'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In former years a large quantity of quicksilver was exported,
but for some time this mineral product has ceased
to appear as an item in the exports, the large deposit of
cinnabar at Tegora having apparently been worked out.
The existence of this mineral in other parts of the state is
proved by traces found in several places, and the same may
be said of antimony, of which there are indications of rich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>deposits; but the discovery of these minerals in paying
quantities is a matter of chance. Antimony is still worked
by the Borneo Company, Ltd., and a recent rise in the price
has been an inducement to Chinese and Malay miners to
increase the production, and the export of 1906 was more
in quantity than it was in 1905, though small as compared
with what it used to be.</p>

<p class='c000'>Black bituminous coal, which occurs in the Tertiary
strata, has been found in different parts, and two collieries
are owned and worked by the Government, at Semunjan in
the Sadong district, and at Brooketon. Several hundred
Chinese are employed as miners under European supervision,
and large sums have been expended upon machinery, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>Oil, a crude petroleum, has been discovered in two
places; it is of good quality, and is an excellent lubricant.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not impossible, or indeed improbable, that diamond
deposits in Sarawak will be found and exploited. No
systematic operations in search of these precious stones have
been attempted, the dense jungle which covers the country
being an obstacle. The only people who wash for
diamonds are the Malays, and these carry on their work in
a very desultory and imperfect manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>But agriculture and jungle produce have been, and will be,
the main source of revenue to Sarawak, and prosperity to the
country. We shall deal with these products, as well as with
those that are mineral, more fully in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Bornean forest is so varied and so different at different
hours and seasons that no description can possibly convey an
adequate idea of it to those who have not known it. Infinite and
ever changing are its aspects, as are the treasures it hides. Its
beauties are as inexhaustible as the varieties of its productions. In
the forest man feels singularly free. The more one wanders in it,
the greater grows the sense of profound admiration before nature in
one of its grandest aspects. The more one endeavours to study it,
the more one finds in it to study. Its deep shades are sacred to the
devotee of Science. Yet they afford ample food for the mind of the
believer, not less than to that of the philosopher.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c011'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>And we would add, to the superstitious native, to whom the
jungles teem with ghosts and spirits.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>The Bornean jungles are full of life, and of the sounds
of life, which are more marked in the early mornings and in
the evenings. Birds are plentiful (there are some 800
species), some of beautiful plumage, but few are songsters.
Insect life is very largely represented, and includes many
varieties of the curious stick and leaf insects,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c011'><sup>[11]</sup></a> hardly to be
distinguished from the twigs and leaves they mimic. Also
the noisy and never tiring cicadas, whose evening concerts
are almost deafening, and frogs and grasshoppers who help
to swell the din. There are many varieties of beautiful
butterflies, but these are to be found more in the open
clearings. Though there are no dangerous animals, there
are many pests, the worst being the leeches, of which there
are three kinds, two that lurk in the grass and bushes, the
other being aquatic—the horse-leech. Mosquitoes, stinging
flies, and ants are common, and the scorpion and centipede
are there as well. Snakes, though numerous, are rarely seen,
for they swiftly and silently retire on the approach of man,
and one variety only, the hamadryad, the great cobra or snake-eating
snake, is said to be aggressive. The varieties of land
and water snakes are many, there being some 120 different
species. Natives often fall victims to snake bites. Pythons
attain a length of over twenty feet;<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c011'><sup>[12]</sup></a> they seldom attack man,
though instances have been known of people having been
killed by these reptiles, and the following story, taken from
the <cite>Sarawak Gazette</cite>, will show how dangerous they can be.
At a little village a man and his small son were asleep together.
In the middle of the night the child shrieked out
that he was being taken by a crocodile, and the father, to his
horror, found that a snake had closed its jaws on the boy's
head. With his hands he prised the reptile's jaws open and
released his son; but in his turn he had to be rescued by
some neighbours, for the python had wound itself around his
body. Neither was much hurt.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Of the wild animals in Sarawak, wild cattle and the
rhinoceros have nearly disappeared before their ruthless
destroyer, man; and such would have been the fate of that
huge, though harmless, anthropoid, the maias, or "orang-utan,"
at the hands of collectors, had not the Government placed a
check upon them by limiting the number each may collect.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c011'><sup>[13]</sup></a>
Deer, the sambur, the muntjac or barking deer, and the
little mouse-deer, and also wild pig, of which there are
several species, abound.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c011'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Numerous too are the monkeys
and apes, and numerous are the species; the more peculiar of
the former being the proboscis monkey, a species confined to
Borneo, and of the latter the gentle gibbons, who announce
the dawn, making the woods ring and echo with their
melodious gurgling whoops. There are two kinds of diminutive
bears, the tree-leopard, wild cat, the scaly ant-eater, the
porcupine, the otter, the lemur, and other small animals,
including the flying fox, flying squirrel, flying lizard, flying
frog, a peculiar kind of rat with a tail which bears a close resemblance
to a feather,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c011'><sup>[15]</sup></a> and huge toads nine inches in height.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c011'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
But to the casual traveller in the dense jungle with but a
limited view, excepting an occasional monkey, or a pig or
deer startled from its lair, few of these animals will be visible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the valuable products of the jungle it will be sufficient
to note here that gutta, camphor, cutch, and dammar-producing
trees abound; also creepers from which rubber is extracted;
and rattans of various kinds. There are trees from the nuts
of which excellent oil is expressed; and many kinds of useful
woods, some exceeding hard and durable, and some ornamental.</p>

<p class='c000'>Man's greatest enemy is the crocodile, and this voracious
saurian becomes a dangerous foe when, driven perhaps by
scarcity of other food, it has once preyed upon man, for, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>the tiger, it then becomes a man-hunter and man-eater. It
will lurk about landing and bathing-places for prey; will
snatch a man bodily from a boat; and one has been known
to seize a child out of its mother's arms while she was bathing
it. The <cite>Sarawak Gazette</cite> records numerous deaths due to
crocodiles, though by no means all that happen, and many
thrilling adventures with these reptiles. Two we will give as
interesting instances of devotion and presence of mind. A
little Malay boy, just able to toddle, was larking in the mud
at low water when he was seized by a crocodile, which was
making for the water with its screaming little victim in its
jaws, when the child's sister, a girl of twelve, and his brother
of eight, rushed to his assistance. The boy hopelessly tried
to stop the crocodile by clinging to one of its fore-paws, but
the girl jumped upon the brute's back, and gradually working
her way to its eyes which were then just above water,
succeeded in gouging out one with her fingers. This caused
the crocodile promptly to drop its prey, but only just in
time, as it was on the point of gliding into deep water. By
the girl's vigorous intervention it not only lost its prey but
also its life, for two men coming up hacked the brute to pieces.
The little heroine had remembered the story of how her
grandfather had formerly saved his life in the same way.
To scoop out the eyes is the only chance of escape for one
taken, and it must be done promptly. The little boy was
scarcely hurt. The girl's courageous deed duly received a
graceful recognition from the Ranee.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another girl, a Dayak girl this time, rescued her mother,
who was dragged out of a boat, in which they were together,
by a large crocodile. She threw herself upon the monster,
and by thrusting her fingers into its eyes compelled the
brute, after a short but sharp struggle, to release its prey.</p>

<p class='c000'>Death caused by a crocodile is one of the most horrible
of deaths, and it is often a protracted one, as the victim
is borne along above water for some distance, then taken
down, bashed against some sunken log, and brought up
again. "May I be killed by a crocodile if I am guilty" is
a common invocation made by Malays in protestation of
their innocence; in other words, they invoke the most dreadful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>death that comes within their ken. So did once a
young Malay woman in the Simanggang Court on being
convicted of a serious crime. That evening, whilst she was
bathing, a smothered cry, that she had barely time to utter,
announced that her prayer had been heard.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are several kinds of crocodiles, broad and long
snouted. In the Perak Museum is a specimen nearly
twenty-five feet in length, but the longest that has been
caught in Sarawak, and authentically measured, was nineteen
feet. The Government gives a reward for killing these
pests, which is paid upon some 250 to 300 annually brought
to the police station at Kuching. More are killed in the
various districts of which no record is kept.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sharks of several species abound, but cases of injury by
these are very rare.</p>

<p class='c000'>Saw-fish are also common, and with their long spiny
saws are dangerous creatures. A fisherman was killed by
one of these at the mouth of the Sadong; he was in a small
canoe when the fish, which he had cut at with his knife,
struck him a blow on his neck with its saw, from which he
died almost immediately.</p>

<p class='c000'>Excellent fish are abundant, such as mackerel and
herring, considerably larger than the English varieties,
pomfret, barbel, soles, mullets, etc., and some of beautiful
colours; also crabs, prawns, and oysters. The dugong
(Malay duyong), the sea-cow, is rare in Sarawak, but
common in North Borneo, as is also the whale; in Sarawak
the latter are occasionally stranded on the beach. Turtles
abound; these are preserved for the sake of their eggs,
which are considered a great delicacy.</p>

<p class='c000'>We will now consider the races that occupy Sarawak
territory; and the following brief ethnological notes with
regard to those of Indonesian stock will be all that is
necessary for the purposes of this book; to attempt anything
like an accurate classification of the many tribes and
sub-tribes which differentiate the heterogeneous population
of the country would be beyond its scope, even were it
possible to trace the divergence of the cognate tribes from
the original stock, and of the sub-tribes from the tribes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>That there may have been earlier inhabitants of Borneo
than those now existing in the island is possible. Traces
of neolithic man have been found, but these may be due to
the first settlers having brought with them stone weapons
cherished as charms. Of paleolithic man not a trace has
been discovered.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c011'><sup>[17]</sup></a> To attempt to determine the flow of
mankind into the country, or to decide which of the tribes
of Indonesian stock now found in Sarawak was the first to
occupy the soil, is to undertake an impossible task.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c011'><sup>[18]</sup></a> It
may be accepted that the most barbarous peoples, the Ukits,
Bukitans, Punans, and other fast vanishing tribes, were the
earliest inhabitants of whom we know anything, and that
they were immigrants. But whence they came we know
not. These tribes are all more or less related in language
and customs, and in Borneo difference in names does not
always denote any essential racial distinction.</p>

<p>A PUNAN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>As an instance of this we have the Lugats, of whom only
a very few are left, the Lisums, the Bliuns, a tribe that has
quite died out, the Segalangs, and the Seru Dayaks of the
Kalaka, a tribe which is fast disappearing. The above sub-tribes
take their name from rivers widely apart, and though
their names differ they are of the same race, sub-tribes of
the Ukits. Their tradition is that three or four hundred
years ago the Ukits lived in the Lugat (now the Gat) river,
a branch of the Baleh (hence we have the Lugats now living
in the Anap), but they were driven out by the Kayans.
Some went to the Lisum river (hence we have the Lisums),
and some to Kapit, where they built strong houses on the
site of the present fort, but these they were eventually
forced to evacuate, and again they migrated down river,
first to Tujong, near the Kanowit, and afterwards farther
down again to Bunut, by Benatang. From Bunut they
were driven out by their implacable foes, and they dispersed
to Segalang (in the Rejang delta), to Bliun (in the Kanowit),
and to Seru in the Kalaka.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c011'><sup>[19]</sup></a> This tradition is supported
by the strong evidence of language, and there is little reason
for disregarding it. After being driven out of Lugat, some
of the Ukits went over to the Kapuas, where, as in the
Baleh, to which river some eventually returned, they are
still known as Ukits. The Bliuns, Segalangs, and Serus
became civilised owing to contact with the Malays and
Melanaus. The Ukits, Bukitans, and Punans, with the exception
of the Punan Bah of Balui, are the wildest of all
the races in the island. The Ukits are light in complexion;
tall and well knit, and better looking than other inland
tribes. Formerly they did not reside in houses, or cultivate
the soil, but roamed about in the jungle, and subsisted on
wild fruit and the animals they killed. But some of these
have begun to erect poor
dwellings, and do a little
elementary farming. They
are expert with the blow-pipe,
and in the manufacture
of the upas-poison, with
which the points of their
needle-like arrows are tinged.
But it is quite open to question
whether these poor
savages may not be a degenerate
race, driven from
their homes and from comparative
civilisation by more
powerful races that followed
and hunted them from their
farms to the jungle. Beccari
(<em>op. cit.</em> p. 363) says that
they "are savages in the
true name of the word, but
they are neither degraded nor
inferior races in the series of
mankind. Their primitive
condition depends more than
anything else on their nomadic
or wandering life, and on the ease with which they
live on the produce of the forests, and on that of the
chase which the sumpitan (blow-pipe) procures for them.
This has no doubt contributed to keep them from associating
with their fellow-beings, and from settling in villages or erecting
permanent houses. I believe that these, although they
must be considered as the remnants of an ancient Bornean
people, are not descended from autochthonous savages, but
are rather the present-day representatives of a race which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>has become savage." And Beccari is of opinion "that it is
difficult to deny that Borneo has had older and perhaps
more primitive inhabitants." The natives have legends of
former races having occupied the land; the most powerful
were, according to the Punans, the Antu-Jalan, who lived in
the Balui, around the mouth of the Belaga, where the fort
of that name now stands. They disappeared, but have now
returned in the persons of the white men. So the Punans
believe, and other tribes hug other myths. These savage
people are, or rather were, the bitter enemies of the Dayaks,
and a terror to them. Silently and unperceived, they would
steal on their hereditary enemies whilst these latter were
collecting jungle produce, or employed on their farms, and
wound them to death with their poisoned arrows.</p>

<p class='c000'>In former days, when they were more powerful, the
Bukitans would openly attack the Dayaks, and as late as
1856 they destroyed one of the large communal Dayak
houses on the Krian, and also attacked the Serikei Dayaks.
The Ukits do not take heads, and the Punans do not tattoo.
The latter and the Bukitans are clever makers of rattan
mats, which are in demand by Europeans and Chinese.
The Ukits and the Bukitans reside on the upper waters of
the Rejang, Baleh, and Kapuas; and the Punans in the
Baram and Balui.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Banyoks and the Seduans are, like the Segalangs,
with whom they have intermixed, probably off-shoots of the
Ukit tribe. They have recently merged, and occupy the
same village in the Rejang below Sibu fort. Like the
Tanjongs and the Kanowits they are clever basket makers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sians, another off-shoot of the Ukits, live below
Belaga fort.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c011'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>All these small tribes inhabiting the interior, though a
few are found near the coast, are dwindling away, mainly in
consequence of in-and-in breeding. Of some of the tribes
of the same stock only a few families are left, and in others
only a few people, while one or two have totally disappeared
within quite recent years.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next Indonesian tribes to follow were the Kayans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and then the Kenyahs, two that are closely allied, and
both, according to tradition, came from the south, probably
from the Celebes. They took possession of the Belungan (or
Batang Kayan) river-basin, and overflowed into those of
Baram and Balui (the right hand branch of the Rejang).
These powerful tribes found these river-basins unoccupied
except by scattered families of the tribes above mentioned,
whom they drove into the jungle. In the Baram they remained
undisturbed, as also in the Rejang till recent years.
Down the latter river they spread as far as Kapit; at that
time both the Sea-Dayaks and Malays were there, and over
them the Kayans domineered, driving the former from their
settlements at Ngmah,<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c011'><sup>[21]</sup></a> and harassing the latter in the
Kanowit, and even in the Sekrang. Eventually, however,
the Kayans were forced to fall back before the ever increasing
Dayaks, and to retire to the head-waters of the Balui,
and now, with the exception of one small settlement, all
reside above the Belaga.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we consider the large area occupied by the tribes
of Kayans and Kenyahs, who may be classed together, it will
be seen how important they are. Besides inhabiting the
upper waters of the Baram and Rejang, they are found in
very large numbers on the Batang Kayan. The Mahkam
(Koti or Coti) is also thickly inhabited by Kayans, and
many live on the Barito (Banjermasin), and on the Kapuas.
The Kayans and Kenyahs are tattooed, as are most of the
savage people of Indonesian origin in the interior. When
the children are young the lobes of the ears are pierced,
and by the insertion of heavy lead or copper rings the
lobes become gradually so distended as to hang down to the
shoulders, and, with elderly women, often lower. That this
is a very old custom, and not peculiar to these people, is
shown by the sculptures in the ancient Boro Budor temple
in Java, where men and women are figured with such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>elongated ear lobes, having ear pendants and plugs exactly
similar to those in use by the Kayans and Kenyahs. Most
Indonesian tribes of the interior retain this fashion.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c011'><sup>[22]</sup></a> These
Kayans and Kenyahs are on a slightly higher grade of civilisation
than the Sea-Dayaks, building finer houses, having
more rule and order among themselves, and being expert in
the manufacture of excellent weapons, extracting their iron
for that purpose from the native ore. In character they are
vindictive and cruel, but brave, and not without some good
qualities. Formerly they practised hideous cruelties on their
captives and slaves, and impalement
was a common form
of punishment. The women
were even more barbarous
than the men, being the most
ingenious and inhuman in devising
tortures. The Kayans
under Sarawak rule have
been checked in these matters,
and human sacrifices have
become a thing of the past.
But that these propensities are
only dormant is instanced by
a case that occurred but a few
years ago, far up the Balui.
Four young Dayaks, survivors
of a party of gutta-percha collectors, who had been cut off and
killed by the Punans, after wandering for many days in the
jungle, arrived destitute and starving at a Kayan house, and
asked for food and shelter. Instead, the Kayans bound the
young men, and, after breaking their legs and arms, handed
them over to the women, who slowly despatched them by
hacking them to pieces with little knives. And in the
Baram, in 1882, a Kayan chief caused two captives to be
bound and thrown down from the lofty verandah of his
house to the ground, where they were decapitated—quite in
Ashantee manner.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c011'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p>KAYAN GIRL, SHOWING ELONGATED EARS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Among the Kayans and Kenyahs a broad distinction
exists between the classes. There are but the chiefs
and their families, and only serfs and slaves under them.
The chiefs are not chosen by the people, as is the case
among the Dayaks. They assume their position by right
of birth, or by might. The position of the serf is little better
than that of the slave, and all they may gain by their
industry is seized by the chiefs. It is the difference that
existed in Germany between the Freie and the Unfreie; in
England in Saxon times between the thegn and the villein.
Although the Kayans take heads in warfare, they do not value
them as do the Dayaks, and will part with them to the
latter; and they are not head-hunters in the strict sense
of the term. The Kayans are a decreasing race, not so
the Kenyahs. Both are capable of improvement, especially
the latter; and they are improving, notably in the Baram,
where they are directly under the control of the Government,
since that river district was ceded to Sarawak in 1883.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tanjongs, Kanowits, Kajamans, and Sekapans,<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c011'><sup>[24]</sup></a> are
cognate tribes, probably of the same stock as the Kayans
and Kenyahs. Formerly they were large tribes, but are
now each reduced to a solitary village. They are to be
found only on the Rejang. The dialects of the two first are
intermediary between those of the Melanaus and the Kayans,
and they live in an intermediary position. The other two
tribes live close to Belaga fort in the Kayan country; their
dialects vary.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Malohs of Kapuas in Dutch Borneo formerly had a
large village at Kanowit, but nearly all have returned to
their own country, and the tribe is now represented by a
sprinkling only among the Sea-Dayaks. They are wonderfully
skilled workers in brass and copper, and manufacture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the peculiar brass corsets worn by the Sea-Dayak women,
and their armlets, anklets, leg and ear-rings, and other
personal ornaments; and they have been known to turn
their talents to making counterfeit coin. They bear a
great reputation for bravery, and are dangerous men to
cross.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lanans live amongst the Kayans, to whom they
are allied, in the Balui, and have seven or eight villages.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sebops and Madangs are Kenyah sub-tribes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Melanau, a large and most important tribe inhabiting
the coast between Kedurong point and the mouths of
the Rejang, is also of Indonesian stock, though, like the
Malays, but in a lesser degree, they are of mixed breed.
In speech these people are allied to the Kayans, and are
regarded by some as a branch tribe. Certain of their
customs are similar, and if they differ from the Kayans in
many respects, this is due partly to environment, but
mainly to the majority of them having embraced
Muhammadanism, and to their having intermarried with the
Malays, with whom they are now to a certain extent
assimilated in customs. They cultivate sago on a large scale,
and since the exit of their old Bruni rulers—or rather
oppressors—are able to enjoy the fruits of their labour, and
have increased their plantations considerably. At Bruit,
Matu, Oya, Muka,<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c011'><sup>[25]</sup></a> and Bintulu, there are jungles of sago
palms, and these places supply by far the largest proportion
of the world's consumption of sago. The people being
industrious and thrifty are well off. The above-named
places are now large towns, and Muka is as large as Bruni.
The Melanaus are skilled in working iron, are good
carpenters, and excellent boat builders. Though they are
by nature, like the cognate Kayans, vindictive and quarrelsome,
serious crime is not common among them, and they
are a law-abiding people. Formerly among the Kayans
and Melanaus when one of their houses was about to be
built, a hole was dug in the ground, a slave woman together
with some beads placed in it, and the first iron-wood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>supporting post was levered up, and then driven through
her into the ground. This was an oblation to the Earth
Spirit.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Kadayans do not appear to be allied to any of the
races in N.W. Borneo; those in Sarawak have migrated
from Bruni within recent times to escape oppression. They
are a peaceful and agricultural race, and many of them
are Muhammadans.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c011'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p>MURUTS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Muruts and Bisayas are considerable tribes inhabiting
the Limbang, Trusan, and Lawas rivers in Sarawak, and
beyond. They are of Indonesian stock, and of them a full
and interesting account has been given by Sir Spenser St.
John in his <cite>Life in the Forests of the Far East</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The heads of all these tribes are dolichocephalic or boat-shaped.
They are yellow-stained, with hair either straight
or slightly waved.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>The Land-Dayaks, so named by Europeans in consequence
of their not being accustomed to go to sea, or even to the
use of boats, either for trading or piratical purposes, number
several tribes, with some variations in language. They
occupy localities up the rivers Sadong, Samarahan, Sarawak,
and Lundu. The remains found among them of Hinduism,
such as a stone-shaped bull,<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c011'><sup>[27]</sup></a> and other carved monumental
stones, and the name of their deity, Jewata, as also the
refusal among them to touch the flesh of cattle and deer,
and the cremation of their dead, show that they must have
been brought into intimate contact with the Hindus, probably
at the time when the Hindu-Javanese Empire of Majapahit
extended to Borneo.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c011'><sup>[28]</sup></a> In customs and appearance they
differ considerably from the other tribes. They have a
tradition that they arrived from the north in large ships,
possibly from Siam or Cochin-China. Having been oppressed
and persecuted and hunted for their heads by the Sea-Dayaks
they have retreated to the tops of hills and rocky
eminences.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the Land-Dayak Captain the Hon. H. Keppel<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c011'><sup>[29]</sup></a> says:—</p>

<p class='c013'>In character he is mild and tractable, hospitable when he is well
used, grateful for kindness, industrious, honest, and simple; neither
treacherous nor cunning, and so truthful that the word of one of
them might safely be taken before the oath of half a dozen Borneans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>(Malays). In their dealings they are very straightforward and correct,
and so trustworthy that they rarely attempt, even after a lapse of
years, to evade payment of a just debt. On the reverse of this
picture there is little unfavourable to be said, and the wonder is
that they have learned so little deceit and falsehood where the
examples before them have been so rife.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>LAND-DAYAK CHIEF, WITH HIS SON AND GRANDSON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is difficult, perhaps impossible now, to assign the
position of the Land-Dayaks with regard to the other
native peoples. Their language is quite different from the
others, and in many other essentials they differ.</p>

<p class='c000'>Distinct from all these races in physical character and
language are the Sea-Dayaks. These are proto-Malays, that
is to say they belong to the same ethnic family, but represent
that stock in a purer, less mixed stage. Radically their
language is the same as the Malay. They are brachycephalic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>bullet-headed, with more or less flattened noses, are straight-haired,
almost beardless, with skin of olive hue, or the colour
of new fallen leaves. They migrated from the west, probably
from Sumatra, at a period previous to the conversion of the
Malays to Islam, for their
language, which with slight
dialectic differences, is purely
Malay, contains no Arabic
except of very recent introduction.
The Sea-Dayak
inhabits the Batang Lupar,
Saribas, Kalaka, and Rejang
rivers. They are gradually
spreading into the rivers of
the north-east, and there are
now a good many in the Oya,
Muka, Tatau, and Baram
districts.</p>

<div  class='figright id009'>
<img src='images/p023.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>SEA-DAYAK CHIEF.<br /><br />(The Pengulu Dalam, Munan)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A Sea-Dayak is a clean
built man, upright in gait, not
tall, the average height being
5 ft. 3 inches. The nose is
somewhat flat, the hair straight
with no curl in it. The
face is generally pleasing
from the frankness and good
nature that show in it. The
women have good figures, light
and elastic; well-formed busts,
with interesting, indeed often
pretty, faces; the skins are,
as already stated, of so light a
brown as to be almost yellow.
They have lustrous dark eyes and black, straight hair.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dayaks are very fond of their parents, brothers,
sisters, and of their children, and often a strong attachment
exists between man and wife that lasts for life. The Dayaks
have each but one wife, but it does not follow by any
means that the first union lasts. A young couple may find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>incompatibility of temper after a week or two, and the union
is dissolved on the plea of a dream inimical to its continuance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Incest is considered to be the worst of crimes, bringing a
curse on the country. Both incest and bigamy were formerly
punishable by a cruel death, now by heavy fines, but for
the former offence the fine is far heavier than for the latter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sea-Dayaks are most hospitable, indeed a breach
of hospitality is regarded as a punishable offence. They
obtained their designation from the English who first came
in contact with them, on account of their skill in navigating
the sea along the coast, although living inland, and to
differentiate them from the Dayaks of Sarawak proper, who
were styled Land-Dayaks, because these latter were inexpert
boatmen, and very few of them could paddle or swim. As
shown farther on, Dayak really signifies an <em>inland man</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sea-Dayak is now the dominant race in Sarawak,
and in time will become so over the whole of the north-west
of Borneo. The spread of this stock in former years appears
to have been slow, owing to continual intestine wars, but
since the advent of the white man, the discontinuance of
these feuds, and the forced adoption of a peaceable life,
these people have increased enormously in numbers. Fifty
years ago there were but few of them to be found outside
the Batang Lupar, Saribas, and Kalaka river-basins,
but now, though the population on these rivers has grown
considerably, it is less than that of the same race on the
Rejang alone, and they are spreading into the Oya, Muka,
Tatau, and Baram river-basins. The Melanau population of
the two first-named rivers live entirely either on the coast or
near to it, and the Dayaks found the upper reaches unoccupied.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sea-Dayaks have many good qualities that are
more or less lacking in the other inland tribes. They are
industrious, honest and thrifty, sober and cheerful, and
comparatively moral. But the characteristics that mainly
distinguish them are energy and independence. They are
exceedingly sensitive, especially the women, and will seek
refuge from shame in suicide;<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c011'><sup>[30]</sup></a> like the Malays the men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>will sometimes, though not often, <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">amok</span></i> when suffering from
depression caused by grief, shame, or jealousy, for in the East
this peculiar form of insanity is by no means confined to the
Malay as is popularly supposed.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c011'><sup>[31]</sup></a> Amongst them general
social equality exists, and it is extended to their women.
They do not suffer their chiefs to abuse their powers as the
Kayan and Kenyah chiefs are allowed to do, but they are
quite ready to submit to them when justness and uprightness
is shown. They are superstitious and restless, and require
a firm hand over them, and, "being like truant children, take
a great advantage of kindness and forbearance, and become
more rebellious if threats are not carried into execution."
This was the advice given by the present Rajah to the
Netherland officials some years ago. Their inherited desire
for human skulls, and their old savage methods of obtaining
them, still, in a degree, have a strong hold on the Sea-Dayak
character, but against this it can be said to their credit that
they are free from cruelty, and never torture a captive as do
the Kayans and other tribes. They are kindly to their
captives, and treat them as members of the family; and
they were a peaceable people before they were led astray
by the half-bred Arabs and the Malays.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sea-Dayaks are the collectors of jungle produce, in
search of which they go on expeditions far into the interior—to
Sumatra, the Malayan States, and North Borneo—and
are away for months at a time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dayak custom of head-hunting is founded on the
same principle as that of scalp-hunting among the North-American
Indians. A young man formerly found it difficult
to obtain a wife till he had got at least one head to present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>to the object of his heart as token of his prowess; but it
was quite immaterial whether the head was that of man
or woman, of old or young. If a Dayak had lost a near
relative it became his duty to obtain a head, for until this
was accomplished, and a head feast had been given, the
family must remain in mourning, and the departed relative
would have no attendant in
Sembayan (the shades); and so
in the event of a chief dying
it was incumbent upon the
warriors of the tribe to procure
one or more heads, in order that
his spirit should be properly
attended by the spirits of those
sacrificed in his honour. Thus
head-hunting became more or
less a natural instinct, and an
obligatory duty.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ancient Chinese jars,<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c011'><sup>[32]</sup></a>
held in great esteem among the
natives, and very highly prized,
being supposed to be possessed
of supernatural powers and healing
virtues,<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c011'><sup>[33]</sup></a> are of various kinds
and value. The Gusi is the
most valued, and is treated with
great care and veneration, and
stands about eighteen inches
high. Then comes the Lingka,
then the Benaga,<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c011'><sup>[34]</sup></a> about two
feet high, ornamented with the
Chinese dragon. The Rusa<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c011'><sup>[35]</sup></a> is the least valued. From
a note made in 1890 these are the lowest prices they
fetch—Gusi tuak, $1000; Gusi bulan, $700; Gusi chendanum,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>$500; Galagiau, $400; Lingka, $310; Rusa, $150,
In 1890 $7 = £1. These jars are all brown in colour. The
Dayaks and Kayans possess a few fine blue and white, and
pink and white, old Chinese jars, some over five feet in
height.</p>

<p class='c000'>About forty years ago an enterprising Chinese petty
dealer took samples of the jars to China and had clever
imitations made. He realised a large sum by the sale, and
started as a merchant on a large scale, grew rich, waxed fat,
and became the leading and wealthiest Chinese merchant
in Kuching. The Malays are clever in "faking" jars,
especially such as are cracked, but the Dayaks are not now
to be deceived by them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dayak village, like those of all interior tribes, is a
communal establishment. It does not consist of separate
huts occupied by any one family, but of large common halls
on platforms, sometimes 800 ft. long, upon which the dwelling-rooms
abut. They are constructed of wood, and are
supported on poles sometimes 20 ft. to 40 ft. above the
ground, the poles being from 6 to 18 inches in diameter.
The largest will contain some 300 people. The following is
a description of the Dayak village of Tunggang from the
late Rajah's journal:—</p>

<p class='c013'>Tunyang<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c011'><sup>[36]</sup></a> stands on the left hand (going up) close to the
margin of the stream, and was enclosed by a slight stockade.
Within this defence there was <em>one</em> enormous house for the whole
population. The exterior of the defence between it and the river
was occupied by sheds for prahus (boats), and at each extremity
were one or two houses belonging to Malay residents.</p>

<p class='c013'>The common habitation, as rude as it is enormous, measures
594 ft. in length, and the front room or street is the entire length
of the building, and 21 feet broad. The back part is divided by
mat partitions into the private apartments of the various families,
and of these there are forty-five separate doors leading from the
public apartment. The widowers and the young unmarried men
occupy the public room, as only those with wives are entitled to
the advantage of a separate room. The floor of the edifice is raised
twelve feet from the ground, and the means of ascent is by the trunk
of a tree with notches cut in it—a most difficult, steep, and awkward
ladder. In front is a terrace fifty feet broad, running partially along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>the front of the building, formed like the floors, of split bamboo.
This platform, as well as the front room, besides the regular inhabitants,
is the resort of dogs, birds, monkeys, and fowls, and
presents a glorious scene of confusion and bustle. Here the
ordinary occupations of domestic labour are carried on. There
were 200 men, women, and children counted in the room, and in
front, whilst we were there in the middle of the day; and allowing
for those who were abroad, or then in their own rooms, the whole
community cannot be reckoned at less than 400 souls. The apartment
of their chief is situated nearly in the centre of the building,
and is larger than any other. In front of it nice mats were spread
on the occasion of our visit, whilst over our heads dangled about
thirty ghastly skulls, according to the custom of these people.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Malay is the latest immigrant. He is of mixed
breed, and the link that holds the Malays together is religion,
for they are Mahomedans, whereas the Kayans, Land and
Sea-Dayaks, and other tribes, are pagans. To accept their
own traditions, the Bruni Malays came from Johore, whereas
the Sarawak Malays, like those of the Malay peninsula, came
direct from the ancient kingdom of Menangkabau. Between
them there is a very marked difference in language, character,
and appearance. Whence the proto-Malay stock came is
a moot point, but it may be of Mongolian origin, subsequently
blended with many other distinct ethnic types, such
as the Arab and Hindu, and in the case of the Bornean
Malay with the Indonesian peoples of their and the neighbouring
islands. The Malays form the main population of
Kuching, the capital, and of the towns Sadong, Simanggang,
Kalaka, and Sibu. They have villages on the Lundu, Saribas,
and lower Rejang, are scattered along the coast between
Capes Datu and Sirik, and are to be found in the principal
settlements beyond. The Malay has been very variously
judged. The Malay Pangiran, or noble, was rapacious,
cruel, and often cowardly. But he had a grace of manner,
a courtesy, and hospitality that were pleasing as a varnish.
The evil repute that the Malay has acquired has been due
to his possession of power, and to his unscrupulous use of it
to oppress the aboriginal races. But the Malay out of
power is by no means an objectionable character. Sir
James Brooke, the first Rajah, thus paints him:—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>The feeling of the Malay fostered by education is acute, and
his passions are roused if shame be put upon him; indeed the dread
of shame amounts to a disease, and the evil is that it has taken a
wrong direction, being more the dread of exposure or abuse, than
shame or contrition for any offence. Like other Asiatics truth is
a rare quality among them, and they have neither principle nor
conscience when they have the means of oppressing an infidel.</p>

<p class='c000'>They are thus depicted by Mr. Horace St. John in a
work somewhat ambitiously entitled, <cite>The Indian Archipelago,
its History and present State</cite>, vol. ii. p. 267 (published 1853).</p>

<p class='c000'>Under the heading "Malays," we find the following:—</p>

<p class='c013'>The Malays are Mahomedans, living under the rule of the
Prophet's descendants, a mongrel race of tyrants, gamblers, opium-smokers,
pirates, and chiefs, who divide their time between cockfighting,
smoking, concubines, and collecting taxes.</p>

<p class='c000'>That Mr. Horace St. John had never been in the
Archipelago to which his history relates, was doubtless a
matter of little consequence to many of his home-staying
contemporaries. Sir Spenser St. John, brother to the
author of the above-quoted <cite>Indian Archipelago, etc.</cite>, who
certainly wrote from a long personal experience of the
people and country, offers us in his <cite>Forests of the Far East</cite>
an opinion on the character and conduct of the Malay from
which every one who has lived amongst these people will find
no important cause to differ. Sir Spenser writes:—</p>

<p class='c013'>The Malays are faithful to their relatives and devotedly
attached to their children. Remarkably free from crimes, and
when they are committed they generally arise from jealousy. Brave
when well led, they inspire confidence in their commanders; they
are highly sensitive to dishonour, and tenacious as regards their
conduct towards each other, and being remarkably polite in manner,
they render agreeable all intercourse with them. Malays are
generally accused of great idleness, and in some sense they deserve
it; they do not like continuous work, but they do enough to
support themselves and families in comfort, and real poverty is
unknown among them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author here refers to the Malays of Sarawak.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir W. H. Treacher,<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c011'><sup>[37]</sup></a> who knows the Malay intimately,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>paints him in favourable colours, now that he is restrained
from tyrannising over the weak. He says:—</p>

<p class='c013'>I am frequently asked if treachery is not one of their
characteristics, and I unhesitatingly answer <em>No</em>. This particular
misconception was probably initiated by the original merchant-adventurers,
and we can imagine what a reception a body of
strange, uninvited, white infidels would receive at the hands of
Mahomedan Malays, whose system of warfare, taking its rise from
the nature of the thickly jungle-covered country they inhabit, is
adapted more for ambuscade than for fighting at close quarters.
Add to that, being Mahomedans, they were by their religion
justified in indulging in piracy and murder where the victims
were infidels. The Malay is possessed of at least as much passive
courage as the average Englishman, and is probably less troubled
by the fear of death and the hereafter than many Christians.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the other hand I must admit that the Malay, owing to his
environment—the balmy climate making no severe calls upon him
in the matters either of food, artificial warmth, or clothing, has not
the bustling energy of the white man, nor the greed for amassing
wealth of the Chinaman, nor does he believe in putting forth
unnecessary energy for a problematical gain; he is like the English
tramp who was always willing—that is, to look on at other people
working, or like that one who complained that he was an unfortunate
medium, too light for heavy work, and too heavy for light
work.</p>

<p class='c000'>The natural savagery of the Malay continually threatens
to break out, and not infrequently does so in the form of
the <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">amok</span></i> (running amuck), the national Malay method of
committing suicide.</p>

<p class='c000'>Apart from this tendency, when under control the
Malay character has much in common with the Mongol,
being, under ordinary circumstances, gentle, peaceable,
obedient, and loyal, but at the same time proud and
sensitive, and with strangers suspicious and reserved.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Malays can be faithful and trustworthy, and they
are active and clever. Serious crime among them is not
common now, nor is thieving. They have a bad propensity
of running into debt, and obtaining advances under
engagements which they never fulfil. They make good
servants and valuable policemen. All the Government
steamers are officered and manned throughout by Malays,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>and none could desire to have better crews. They are the
principal fishermen and woodsmen. Morality is perhaps
not a strong point with them, but drinking is exceptional,
and gambling is not as prevalent as it was, nor do they
indulge in opium smoking.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to the Chinaman, it will be well to let the
present Rajah speak from his own experience. He says
that—</p>

<p class='c013'>John Chinaman as a race are an excellent set of fellows, and
a poor show would these Eastern countries make without their
energetic presence. They combine many good, many dangerous,
and it must be admitted, many bad qualities. They are given
to be overbearing and insolent (unless severely kept down) nearly
to as great a degree as Europeans of the rougher classes. They
will cheat their neighbours and resort to all manner of deception
<em>on principle</em>. But their redeeming qualities are comparative charitableness
and liberality; a fondness for improvements; and, except
in small mercantile affairs or minor trading transactions, they are
honest.</p>

<p class='c013'>They, in a few words, possess the wherewithal to be good
fellows, and are more fit to be compared to Europeans than any
other race of Easterns.</p>

<p class='c013'>They have been excluded as much as possible from gaining a
footing in Batavia,<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c011'><sup>[38]</sup></a> under the plea of their dangerous and usurious
pursuits; but the probability is that they would have raised an
unpleasant antagonism in the question of competition in that
country. The Chinaman would be equal to the Master, or White
Man, if both worked fairly by the sweat of his brow. As for their
usury, it is not of so dangerous a character as that which prevails
among the Javanese and the natives.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon my first arrival I was strongly possessed by the opinion
that the Chinamen were all rascals and thieves—the character so
generally attached to the whole race at home. But to be candid,
and looking at both sides, I would as soon deal with a Chinese
merchant in the East as with one who is European, and I believe
the respectable class of Chinese to be equal in honesty and integrity
to the white man.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Chinese may be nearly as troublesome a people to
govern as Europeans, certainly not more so; and their good
qualities, in which they are not deficient, should be cherished and
stimulated, while their bad ones are regulated by the discipline
of the law under a just and liberal government. They are a people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>specially amenable to justice, and are happier under a stringent
than a lenient system.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the Chinese the <cite>Sarawak Gazette</cite> (November 1, 1897)
says:—</p>

<p class='c013'>The characteristics of this extraordinary people must at once
strike the minds of the most superficial of European residents in the
East. Their wonderful energy and capacity for work; their power
of accumulating wealth; their peculiar physical powers, which render
them equally fertile, and their children equally vivacious, on the
equator as in more temperate regions, and which enable them to rear
a new race of natives under climatic conditions entirely different from
those under which their forefathers were born, are facts with which
we are all acquainted. Their mental endowments, too, are by no
means to be despised, as nearly every year shows us, when the
results of the examination for the Queen's Scholarship of the
Straits Settlements are published, and some young Chinese boy
departs for England to enter into educational competition with his
European fellows.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chinese get on well with all natives, with whom they
intermarry, the mixed offspring being a healthy and good-looking
type. They form the merchant, trading, and artisan
classes, and they are the only agriculturists and mine
labourers of any worth. Without these people a tropical
country would remain undeveloped.</p>

<p class='c000'>The only census that appears to have been attempted in
Sarawak was taken in 1871. Judging by the report that
was published in the <cite>Gazette</cite> this census was made in a very
imperfect manner.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c011'><sup>[39]</sup></a> Of the interior population it includes
Sea-Dayaks, but no means were obtainable for ascertaining
the numbers of Kayans, Kenyahs, and many other
tribes that go to make up the population of the State.
It makes no separate mention of the large coast population
of the Melanaus, who were presumably lumped with the
Malays.</p>

<p class='c000'>The census gives the following figures:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The report concedes it was the generally received
opinion that the population was nearer 200,000, and if we
include the Kayans, Kenyahs, etc., and accept the approximate
correctness of the above figures, that estimate would be
about correct.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1871, the State extended as far as Kedurong Point
only, but since that the territorial area has been nearly
doubled. The population is now estimated at 500,000,

<p class='c000'>The names by which the various tribes are known are
those given to them by others, mostly by the coast people,
or are taken from the name of the river on which they reside,
or from which they came. <em>Daya</em> (as it should be spelt, and
as it is pronounced) in the Melanau and Bruni Malay dialect
means "land," "in-land." So we have <em>Orang daya</em>, an inlander.
<em>Ka-daya-an</em> is contracted into <em>Kayan</em>; <em>Ukit</em> and
<em>Bukitan</em> are from the Malay word <em>bukit</em>—a hill; and <em>tanjong</em>
is the Malay for a cape or a point round which a river
sweeps. Hence <em>Orang Ukit</em> or <em>Bukitan</em>, a hill-man,<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c011'><sup>[40]</sup></a> and
<em>Orang Tanjong</em>, riverside people.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>As in ancient Germany the districts were known by the
names of the rivers that watered them, and each was a <em>gau</em>, so
it is in Borneo, where the rivers are the roads of communication,
and give their names to the districts and to the people
that inhabit them. Indeed, in Borneo one can see precisely
at this day what was the ancient <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gau-verfassung</span></i> in the
German Empire.</p>

<p class='c000'>The area of Sarawak is about 50,000 square miles, and
the coast line about 500 miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>The climate is hot and humid; it is especially moist
during the N.E. monsoon, and less so during the S.W.
monsoon. The former commences and the latter ends sometimes
early and sometimes late in October, and in April the
seasons again change. The months of most rain are
December, January, and February; from February the rainfall
decreases until July, the month of least rain, and
increases gradually after that month. The average yearly
rainfall is 160 inches. The maximum in any one year,
225.95 inches, was recorded in 1882, and the minimum
102.4 in 1888. The heaviest rainfall for one month, 69.25
inches, occurred in January, 1881, and the least, .66 inches,
in August, 1877. The most in one day was 15.3 inches on
February 8, 1876. Rain falls on an average 226 days in
the year. These notes are taken from observations made in
Kuching extending over thirty years.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c011'><sup>[41]</sup></a> At Sibu, the average
rainfall for five years was 116 inches, at Baram 92 inches,
and at Trusan 167 inches. Except in the sun at mid-day
and during the early hours of the afternoon the heat is hardly
ever oppressive, and the mornings, evenings and nights are
generally cool. In 1906, the maximum average temperature
was 91°.6, and the minimum 71°.2 Fahrenheit; the
highest reading was 94° in May, and the lowest 69°.6 in
July.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c011'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In few countries are thunderstorms more severe than in
Borneo, but deaths from lightning are not very common, and
hail falls so rarely that when it does fall it is an awe-inspiring
object to some natives. Archdeacon Perham records that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>during a very severe hailstorm in 1874 some Dayaks collected
the hailstones under the impression that they were
rare charms, whilst others fled from their house, believing that
everybody and everything in it would be turned into a
petrified rock, a woeful monument to future generations. To
avert this catastrophe they boiled the hailstones and burnt
locks of their hair.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c011'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The name Borneo is a corruption of Burni, itself a corruption of Beruni or
Bruni, the capital of that ancient but now decayed Sultanate bearing the same name,
and of which Sarawak, and a great part of British North Borneo, once formed parts.
It was the first place in Borneo with which the Spanish and Portuguese had any
dealings, and in their old chronicles it is referred to as Burni, and Borneo subsequently
became the distinguishing name of the whole island to Europeans. The natives
themselves have none, except perhaps the doubtful one of Pulau Ka-lamanta-an, the
island of raw sago, so named in recent times by the merchants and traders of the
Straits Settlements as being the island from which that commodity was brought, and
in those settlements it has since become the native name for Borneo. But in
Sarawak this name is known to the Malays alone, and in other parts of Borneo,
perhaps only a few have heard of it. In fact, it is applicable to Sarawak only, for
in former days sago was exported to the Straits solely from that country, and the
trade was carried on by Sarawak Malays, first with Penang and subsequently with
Singapore. An old English map of about 1700 gives to the town of Bruni, as well as
to the whole island, the name of Borneo. Mercator (1595) also gives Borneo to both.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bruni is variously spelt Brunai, Brunei, Bruné, Borneo, Borney, Bornei, Porne,
and Burni by old writers; all corruptions of Bruni. The Sanskrit word Bhurni,
meaning land or country, has been suggested as the origin of the name.</p>

evidently a corruption of 'patma' or 'padma,' the sacred lotus (<em>Nelumbian

of the many traces of the ancient faith once professed by the Dayaks, who have
preserved the memory of the emblematical flower, transferring its name to that of
another plant conspicuous for its size and singular appearance. In Java, as well as
in Sumatra, the <em>Rafflesia</em> is known as 'Patma'; but there the fact is not surprising,
for the prevalence of Hinduism in those islands is a matter of not very remote history."

from jail, arose in the middle of the night, and speared or cut down all the inmates
of the house—thirteen women and children, of whom only two or three survived.
He was shot by Mr. Q. A. Buck, then the Resident at Sibu (joined 1874, retired 1899),

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Borneo was known
to the Arabs many
centuries ago, and
Sinbad the Sailor
was fabled to have
visited the island. It
was then imagined
that a ship might be
freighted there with
pearls, gold, camphor,
gums, perfumed oils,
spices, and gems, and
this was not far from the
truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Genghis Khan
conquered China, and
founded his mighty Mogul
Empire (1206-27), it is possible that
he extended his rule over Borneo,
where Chinese had already settled.
Kublai Khan is said to have invaded
Borneo with a large force in 1292;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>and that a Chinese province was subsequently established in
northern Borneo, in which the Sulu islands were included,
is evidenced by Bruni and Sulu traditions. The Celestials
have left their traces in the name of Kina Balu (the Chinese
Widow) given to the noble peak in the north of the island,<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c011'><sup>[44]</sup></a>
and of the rivers Kina-batangan (the Chinese river) and
Kina-bangun on the east coast of Borneo, and certain jars,
mentioned in chapter I. p. <a href='#Page_26'>26</a>, ornamented with the royal
dragon of China, are treasured as heirlooms by the Dayaks.
At Santubong, at the mouth of the Sarawak river, Chinese
coins dating back to <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 600 and 112, and from <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 588
and onwards, have been found, with many fragments of
Chinese pottery. The name Santubong is itself Chinese,
San-tu-bong, meaning the "King of the Jungle" in the
Kheh dialect, and the "Mountain of wild pig" in the Hokien
dialect.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the antique jars, the art of making which
appears to have been lost, further evidence of an ancient
Chinese trade may be found in the old and peculiar beads
so treasured by the Kayans and Kenyahs. These are
generally supposed to be Venetian, and to have been introduced
by the Portuguese. Beccari (<em>op. cit.</em> p. 263) mentions
that he had heard or read that the Malay word for a bead,
<em>manit</em> (pronounced <em>maneet</em>), was a corruption of the Italian
word <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">moneta</span></i> (money), which was used for glass beads at the
time when the Venetians were the foremost traders in the
world. But he points out "that the Venetians made their
beads in imitation of the Chinese, who it appears had used
them from the remotest times in their commercial transactions
with the less civilized tribes of Southern Asia and the
Malay islands." And it was by the Chinese these beads were
probably introduced into Borneo; <em>manit</em> is but the Sanskrit
word <em>mani</em>, meaning a bead.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c011'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>From the Kina-batangan river came the Chinese wife of
Akhmed, the second Sultan of Bruni. She was the daughter
of Ong Sum Ping, a Chinese envoy, and from her and Sultan
Akhmed the Bruni sultans down to the present day, and
for over twenty generations, trace their descent on the distaff
side, for their daughter married the Arab Sherip Ali, who
became Sultan in succession to his father-in-law, and they
were the founders of the present dynasty.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c011'><sup>[46]</sup></a> Sulu chronicles
contain the same legend; and according to these Ong Sum
Ping, or Ong Ti Ping, settled in the Kina-batangan <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
1375. He was probably a governor in succession to
others.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Hindu-Javan empire of Majapahit in Java certainly
extended over Borneo, but it left there no such stately
temples and palaces as those that remain in Java, and the
only reminiscences of the Hindu presence in Sarawak are
the name of a god, Jewata,<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c011'><sup>[47]</sup></a> which lingers among the Dayaks,
a mutilated stone bull, two carved stones like the lingams
of the Hindus; and at Santubong, on a large immovable rock
situated up a small stream, is a rudely carved statue of a
human figure nearly life-size, with outstretched arms, lying
flat, face downwards, in an uncouth position, perhaps commemorative
of some crime.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c011'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Santubong is at the eastern mouth of the Sarawak river,
and is prettily situated just inside the entrance, and at the
foot of the isolated peak bearing the same name, which rises
boldly out of the sea to a height of some 3000 feet. This
place, which apparently was once a Chinese, and then a
Hindu-Javan colony, is now a small fishing hamlet only,
with a few European bungalows, being the sea-side resort of
Kuching; close by are large cutch works. In ancient days,
judging by the large quantity of slag that is to be seen here,
iron must have been extensively mined.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Recently some ancient and massive gold ornaments,
seal rings, necklets, etc., were exposed by a landslip at the
Limbang station, which have been pronounced to be of
Hindu origin; and ancient Hindu gold ornaments have
been found at Santubong and up the Sarawak river.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bruni had been a powerful kingdom, and had conquered
Luzon and the Sulu islands before it became a dependency
of Majapahit, but at the time of the death of the last Batara<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c011'><sup>[49]</sup></a>
of that kingdom, Bruni ceased to send tribute. The empire
of Majapahit fell in 1478<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c011'><sup>[50]</sup></a> before the Mussulman Malays.
The origin of the Malays is shrouded in obscurity; they are
first heard of in Sumatra, in Menangkabau,<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c011'><sup>[51]</sup></a> from whence
they emigrated in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1160 to Singapura, "the Lion city."
They were attacked and expelled in 1252 by the princes
of Majapahit, when they settled in Malacca. There they
throve, and embraced the religion of Islam in 1276.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>From Sumatra and the Malay peninsula the Malays
continued to spread, and gradually to establish sultanates
and states under them. The process by which this was
effected was seldom by conquest, but by the peaceful
immigration of a few families who settled on some
unoccupied part of the coast within the mouth of a river.
Then, in the course of time, they increased and spread to
neighbouring rivers, and formed a state. By subjecting the
aboriginal tribes of the interior, and by compulsion or consent,
including weaker Malayan states of like origin, by
degrees some of these states expanded into powerful
sultanates with feudal princes under them.</p>

<p class='c000'>So the Malayan kingdoms arose and gained power; and
strengthened by the spirit of cohesion which their religion
gave them, they finally overthrew the Hindu-Javan empire
of Majapahit.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Borneo there were sultans at Bruni, Sambas,
Banjermasin, Koti, Belungan, Pasir, Tanjong, Berau, and
Pontianak, and other small states under pangirans and
sherips.</p>

<p class='c000'>Exaggerated accounts of the "sweet riches of Borneo"
had led the early Portuguese, Dutch, and English voyagers to
regard the island, the Insula Bonæ Fortunæ of Ptolemy, as
the <i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">El Dorado</span></i> of the Eastern Archipelago; but these in turn
found out their error, and, directing their attention to the
more profitable islands in its neighbourhood, almost forsook
Borneo until later years.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Spaniards appear to have been the first Europeans
to visit the island, as they were the first to make the voyage
round the world, and to find the way to the Archipelago from
the east, a feat which caused the Portuguese much uneasiness.
They touched at Bruni in 1521, and Pigafetta says
that there were then 25,000 families in the city, which on a
low computation would give the population at 100,000; and
he gives a glowing account of its prosperity. The Portuguese,
under the infamous Jorge de Menezes, followed in 1526, and
they were there again in 1530. They confirm Pigafetta as to
the flourishing condition of the place. From 1530 the
Portuguese kept up a regular intercourse with Bruni from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Malacca, which the great Alfonso d'Albuquerque had
conquered in 1511, until they were expelled from that
place by the Dutch in 1641. Then they diverted the trade,
which was chiefly in pepper, to their settlement at Macao,
where they had placed a Factory in 1557, and from whence
a Roman Catholic mission was established at Bruni by Fr.
Antonio di Ventimiglia, who died there in 1691. It seems
certain they had a Factory at Bruni, probably for a short
time only, in the seventeenth century, though it is impossible
now to do more than conjecture the date; but that they
continued their trade with Bruni up to the close of the
eighteenth century appears to be without doubt; and also
that they had a Factory at Sambas out of which they were
driven by the Dutch in 1609. On Mercator's map, alluded
to in the first footnote of this chapter, are the words
"<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Lave donde foÿ Don Manuel de Lima</span>," or Lave where
Don Manuel of Lima<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c011'><sup>[52]</sup></a> resided. Lave is Mempawa, sometimes
spelt Mempava in recent English maps, a place
between Sambas and Pontianak—so the Portuguese
were even farther south than Sambas in the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1565, the Spanish took possession of the Philippines,
conquered Manila in 1571, and, five years later, according to
both Spanish and Bruni records, were taking an active
interest in Bruni affairs, which, however, does not appear to
have lasted for long. In 1576, Saif ul Rejal was Sultan.
In the Bruni records<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c011'><sup>[53]</sup></a> it is stated that a noble named Buong
Manis, whose title was Pangiran Sri Lela (Sirela in the
Spanish records), was goaded into rebellion by the Sultan's
brother, Rajah Sakam, by the abduction of his daughter on
the day of her wedding. To gain a footing in Bruni the
Spaniards took advantage of this, and Don Francisco La
Sande, the second Governor of the Philippines, conquered
Bruni, and set Sri Lela on the throne. Four years later the
Spaniards again had occasion to support their <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span></i> with an
armed force; but it ended in the rightful Sultan being
restored through the efforts of the Rajah Sakam, aided by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Portuguese, who had become a Bruni pangiran,<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c011'><sup>[54]</sup></a> and the
usurper taking refuge in the Belait, where he was slain. To
close the history, so far as it is known to us, of the Spanish
connection with Bruni, in 1645, in retaliation for piracies
committed on the coasts of their colonies, the Spanish sent
an expeditionary force to punish Bruni, which it appears was
very effectually done.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first Dutchman to visit Bruni was Olivier Van Noort,
in 1600. He seems to have been impressed by the politeness
and civility of the Bruni nobles, but, fortunately for himself,
not to the extent of trusting them too much, for treachery
was attempted. Nine years later, as we have noticed, the
Portuguese had to make room for the Dutch at Sambas, and
here the latter established a Factory, which was, however,
abandoned in 1623. They returned to this part of Borneo
in 1778, and established Factories at Pontianak, Landak,
Mempawa, and Sukadana, but these proving unprofitable were
abandoned in 1791. In 1818, an armed force was sent to
re-establish these Factories, two years after Java had been
restored to Holland by England, and from these, including
Sambas, the Dutch Residency of Western Borneo has
arisen.</p>

<p class='c000'>A certain Captain Cowley appears to have been the first
Englishman, of whom we know anything, to visit Borneo, or
at least that part of it with which this history deals, and in
1665 he spent some little time at "a small island which lay
near the north end of Borneo,"<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c011'><sup>[55]</sup></a> but he did not visit the mainland;
perhaps, however, he may not have been the first. As
far back as 1612, Sir Henry Middleton projected a voyage
to Borneo. He died at Bantam in Java, where the East
India Company had established a Factory in 1603, but it was
not until 1682 that the Dutch expelled the English from
that place, and from thence to Borneo is too simple an
adventure not to have been attempted and accomplished by
the daring old sea-dogs of those days. According to
Dampier, a Captain Bowry was in Borneo in 1686;<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c011'><sup>[56]</sup></a> some
English were captured by the Dutch when they took Sukadana
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>in 1687; and there were probably others there before,
but no settlement on the north and north-western shores was
effected by the English until 1773, when the East India
Company formed a settlement at Balambangan, an island
north of Marudu Bay, the same probably as that on which
Captain Cowley had stayed. This settlement, however, was
but short lived, for in February 1775 it was attacked by a
small force of Sulus and Lanuns led by a cousin of the
Sultan of Sulu, Datu Teting. The garrison of English and
Bugis was more than sufficient to have repelled the attack,
but they were taken completely by surprise; the Resident
and the few settlers managed to escape in what vessels
they could find.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c011'><sup>[57]</sup></a> A number of cannon and muskets, and
considerable booty, fell into the hands of the raiders. The
motive for this act was revenge; the English had behaved
badly to the natives of the neighbouring islands, and Datu
Teting had himself suffered the indignity of being placed in
the stocks when on a visit to the settlement. The Company
had established a Factory at Bruni as well, having obtained
from the Sultan the monopoly of the pepper trade, and to
this Factory the survivors retired, but some settled on the
island of Labuan, where they made a village. In 1803,
the Company again established themselves at Balambangan,
but after a short occupation abandoned the island, together
with the Factory at Bruni. No punishment followed Datu
Teting's act, and British <em>prestige</em> in northern Borneo was
destroyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is briefly the whole history of British enterprise in
that part of Borneo lying north of the equator, and it reflects
little credit on the part played by our countrymen in Eastern
affairs in those days.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have shown that Bruni early in the fourteenth
century possessed a population of at least 100,000. According
to Sir Hugh Low, two hundred years after Pigafetta's
visit, the population was estimated at 40,000, with a Chinese
population in its neighbourhood of 30,000, engaged in planting
pepper.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c011'><sup>[58]</sup></a> In 1809, the city had shrunk to 3000 houses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>with a population of 15,000.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c011'><sup>[59]</sup></a> In 1847, Low placed the
population at 12,000; the Chinese had then disappeared,
excepting a few who had been reduced to slavery. The
population, still diminishing, is now under 8000.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the picturesque hills that surround the town are still
to be found traces of thriving plantations which formerly
existed there, and which extended for many miles into the
interior. These have totally disappeared, with the population
which cultivated them. In 1291, two centuries before the first
European vessel rounded the Cape,<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c011'><sup>[60]</sup></a> Ser Marco Polo visited
the Archipelago. He gives us the first narrative we possess
of the Chinese junk trade to the westward, and mentions a
great and profitable traffic carried on by the Chinese with
Borneo,<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c011'><sup>[61]</sup></a> and this trade throve for many years afterwards;
even in 1776 the commerce with China was considerable,<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c011'><sup>[62]</sup></a>
though then it must have been declining, for it had ceased
before the close of that century. Hunt records that in his
time there were still to be seen at Bruni old docks capable
of berthing vessels of from 500-600 tons. Now the most
striking feature of the place is its profound poverty.
Nothing remains of its past glory and prosperity but its
ancient dynasty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Hugh Low tells us that these old Malay kingdoms
appear to have risen to their zenith of power and prosperity
two hundred years after their conversion to Islam, and then
their decline commenced, but he should have added half a
century to this epoch. The late Rajah was of opinion that
perhaps the introduction of Muhammadanism may have been
the cause of their deterioration. Two hundred and fifty years
after the conversion of the Malays to Muhammadanism, and
under the ægis of this religion, all the Malayan States
attained their zenith. This period was coetaneous with the
appearance of what may fairly be described as their <em>white peril</em>,
and the introduction of Muhammadanism, a religion which
Christians, in their ignorance of its true precepts, are too apt
wholly to condemn, brought with it the pernicious sherips,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>the pests of the Archipelago. The decay of the old Malayan
kingdoms was due primarily to the rapacious and oppressive
policy adopted by Europeans in their early dealings with
these States, which was continued in a more modified form
until within recent times. How this was brought about, and
how the sherips contributed to it, is in the sequel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Prior to the advent of the late Rajah in 1838, Sarawak
appears to have attracted no attention, except that Gonsavo
Pereira, who made the second Portuguese visit to Bruni in
1530, says that Lave (Mempawa), Tanjapura (which cannot
be identified), and Cerava (Sarawak) were the principal ports,
and contained many wealthy merchants; and Valentyn
relates that in 1609 the Dutch found that Calca (Kalaka),
Saribas, and Melanugo had fallen away from Borneo (Bruni)
and placed themselves under the power of the king of
Johore.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c011'><sup>[63]</sup></a> Melanugo is also difficult to identify, but it may
be that a transcriptive error has crept in somewhere, and
that it refers to the Malanau districts beyond Kalaka.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c011'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Sarawak Malays claim their origin from the ancient
Kingdom of Menangkabau in Sumatra. Fifteen generations
back, one Datu Undi, whose title was Rajah Jarom, a prince
of the royal house of Menangkabau, emigrated with his people
to Borneo, and settled on the Sarawak river. This prince
had seven children, the eldest being a daughter, the Datu
Permisuri.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c011'><sup>[65]</sup></a> She married a royal prince of Java (this was
after the downfall of Majapahit), and from them in a direct
line came the Datu Patinggi Ali, of whom more will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>noticed in the sequel, and the lineage is now represented by
his grandson, the present Datu Bandar of Sarawak.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Datu Permisuri remained in Sarawak. Rajah
Jarom's eldest son established himself in the Saribas; his
third son in the Samarahan; the fourth in the Rejang;<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c011'><sup>[66]</sup></a> and
the fifth up the right-hand branch of the Sarawak, from
whence his people spread into the Sadong. These settlements
increased within their original limits, but were not
extended beyond the Rejang.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beyond this the Malays of Sarawak know little; but
that these settlements must have early succumbed to the
rising power of Bruni is evident. But it is also evident that
after that power had commenced to wane, its hold over
Sarawak gradually weakened until it became merely nominal.
In 1609, the year they established themselves at Sambas,
the Dutch found that these districts had fallen away from
Bruni, as we have noticed. There may have been, and
probably were, spasmodic assertions of authority on the part
of Bruni, but it seems fairly evident that the Sarawak Malays
managed to maintain an independence more or less complete
for many years, up to within a very short period of the late
Rajah's arrival, and then they had placed themselves again
under the sovereignty of the Sultan, only to be almost
immediately driven into rebellion by Pangiran Makota, the
Sultan's first and last governor of Sarawak.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just a century after the Portuguese had shown the way,
and had won for their king the haughty title of "Lord of
the Navigation and Commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia,
and India," the English and the Dutch appeared in the
Archipelago. The latter under Houtman, who had learnt
the way from the Portuguese under whom he had served, were
the first, in 1595, if we exclude Drake, 1578, and Cavendish,
ten years later, and both merely passed through the southern
portion of the Archipelago on their way home on their
voyages round the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the seventeenth century the English confined their
energies to buccaneering and trading, and established only
two Factories, at Bantam 1603, and at Bencoolen 1685. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Dutch went in for conquest, established themselves strongly
at Jakatra, renamed by them Batavia, in 1611, and then proceeded
to drive the Portuguese out of their settlements. The
power of Portugal had been humbled by Spain, and the
courageous spirit of the old conquistadores had departed. One
by one her settlements were wrested from her, and by the end
of the century Holland was paramount in the Archipelago.
Beyond one or two abortive descents upon Luzon, one, probably
the last, under the famous Tasman, the Dutch had left
the Spaniards undisturbed in the Philippines, but to the
English was left Bencoolen only, Bantam having been taken
away from them in 1682, and to the Portuguese a portion
of the island of Timor.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the latter half of the eighteenth century commenced
the rise of Great Britain as a political power in the
Malayan Peninsula and Archipelago. In 1760, her only
settlements, those on the western coast of Sumatra, had
been destroyed by the French, but these were re-established
in 1763, and Bencoolen was fortified. In 1786, the colony
at Penang (Prince Edward's island) was established; and nine
years later Malacca was captured from the Dutch.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in the nineteenth century came the temporary
downfall of Holland. In 1811, Java was taken by the
British, and the Dutch settlements and dependencies passed
into their hands, though these were soon to be restored.
After subjugating the independent princes of the interior and
introducing order throughout Java, which the Dutch had so
far failed to accomplish, all her possessions in the Archipelago
were restored to Holland in 1816; and in 1825 Bencoolen
was exchanged for Malacca. Singapore was founded in 1819.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Borneo south of the equator, excepting Sukadana,
which has already been mentioned, Banjermasin had been
the only country to attract attention, and in this formerly
rich pepper country the Dutch and English were alternately
established. As early as 1606, the former, with disastrous
results, attempted to establish a Factory there, and after that
experience they appear to have left the place severely alone,
and the Banjers were free of the <em>white peril</em> for another
century. Then, in 1702, the East India Company established
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>a Factory there. As this venture is an interesting illustration
of the methods adopted by the English, and an example
of their common misconduct and mismanagement, we give a
few particulars. The old Dutch chronicler, Valentyn, tells
us how the Factor, Captain Moor, who lived in a house
constructed on a raft, with only a wretched earth rampart
ashore, and a handful of English and Bugis (of the Celebes)
soldiers, laid a heavy hand on the people, but managed to
hold his own, until in 1706 a Captain Barry commenced
building a proper fort, but he died before it was completed.
Then a surgeon, who was more interested in natural history
than anything else, became Factor. The aggression of the
English increased, and the Sultan drove them out with the
loss of many men and two ships. Captain Beeckman, of
the H.E.I. Company's service, who was there in 1713,
ascertained that Captain Barry had been poisoned, and he
tells us so hateful had their servants rendered the name of
the Company to the Banjereens that he had to pretend his
ships were private traders. They had promised the Sultan
to build no forts nor make soldiers. They grossly ill-treated,
and even murdered the natives, imposed duties, and finally
insulted the Sultan, and attempted to capture the queen-mother.
The English, taken by the natives, including a
Captain Cockburn, were put to a cruel death.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c011'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Then came the Dutch once more, in 1747. They left in
1810, and the Sultan then petitioned the English to settle
there again. This was done, but, simultaneously with their
evacuation of Java, the English retired from Banjermasin, and
it was transferred to the Dutch, who shortly afterwards re-established
their old stations in western Borneo up to Sambas.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dutch continued to extend their influence, till, in
process of time, they had acquired control over two-thirds of
the island.</p>

<p class='c000'>Necessarily this is but a brief summary of the political
history of Borneo, and of the countries adjacent to it up to the
time when commences our story of the north-western portion
of the island, but it may be deemed sufficient to afford the
reader a clearer insight into the narrative that follows.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>The system of trade adopted by the Dutch, following in
the footsteps of the Portuguese, was bad. Each in turn
made of trade a monopoly, excluding the vessels of every
other nation. Such produce of the country as was suitable
for the Chinese market had to be sent first to one of their
own <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">depôts</span>, thence to be transhipped to China, and all direct
intercourse with China was checked. This cessation of
direct trade affected the prosperity of the ports, among others
Bruni, in a variety of ways. First, by the circuitous direction
of the trade the exports became too expensive to fetch the
cost of the double carriage, and in course of time dwindled
to nothing. In the next place, the cessation of immediate
intercourse with China arrested the flow of immigrants, hard-working
and frugal men, who would have exploited the
industries and natural products of the island. A third, and
that the most serious effect of all, as a result of the extinction
of honest trade and internal development, was the encouragement
given to piracy. The sultans and rajahs were unable
to maintain their state, and the people to satisfy their requirements
by just means, and so commenced to live by piracy.
So long as immediate requirements were satisfied by this
means, they gave no thought to the morrow; it did not
occur to them, or they were too ignorant to consider, that
they were pulling up by the roots that on which the future
prosperity of their countries depended.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Dutch had no sooner established themselves at
Batavia than, not satisfied with transferring to it the emporium
of Bantam, they conceived the idea of making it the
sole and only <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">depôt</span> of the commerce of the Archipelago....
The destruction of the native trade of the Archipelago by
this withering policy may be considered as the origin of
many of the evils and of all the piracies of which we now
complain. A maritime and commercial people, suddenly
deprived of all honest employment, or the means of respectable
subsistence, either sunk into apathy and indolence, or expended
their natural energies in piratical attempts to recover
by force and plunder what they had been deprived of by
policy and fraud." So wrote Sir Stamford Raffles in 1821.</p>

<p class='c000'>That bold, old west-country buccaneer, and erstwhile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>captain of the King's Navy, William Dampier, who besides
being a shrewd fighter and trader, appears to have been
equally as shrewd an observer, draws a sad picture of the
degradation of flourishing states under the grinding power of
the Dutch. He relates that the natives had ever been willing
to trade with all nations, but the Dutch East India
Company not only monopolised all the trade of those
countries under their immediate control, but by means of
their guard-ships prevented the adjacent countries trading
with others than themselves, even with those of their own
countrymen who were not connected with the Company,
though they were not in a position to supply these countries
with all the commodities their inhabitants needed, or to
purchase or load all their produce.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c011'><sup>[68]</sup></a> The cultivation of
pepper naturally declined,<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c011'><sup>[69]</sup></a> and in some places the natives
were prevented planting more than the Company would
require. So it was with spices. In October every year the
Dutch would send a large force throughout the spice islands
to destroy trees, so as to keep the production down, and small
garrisons were scattered about, whose sole duty appears to
have been to see that the cultivation of spices was restricted
to the requirements of the Dutch alone.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c011'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>"The people, though they are Malayans, yet they are civil
enough, engaged thereto by trade; for the more trade the
more civility; and, on the contrary, the less trade the more
barbarity and inhumanity. For trade has a strong influence
upon all people, who have found the sweet of it, bringing
with it so many conveniences of life as it does. I find the
Malayans in general are implacable enemies to the Dutch;
and all seems to spring from an earnest desire they have of a
free trade, which is restrained by them where they have any
power. But 'tis freedom only must be the means to encourage
any of these remote people to trade,—especially such
of them as are industrious, and whose inclinations are bent
this way, as most of the Malayans are.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>"Where there is any trade to be had, yet not sufficient to
maintain a Factory, or where there may not be a convenient
place to build a fort, so as to secure the whole trade to
themselves, they (the Dutch) send their guard-ships, which,
lying at the mouth of the rivers, deter strangers from coming
thither, and keep the petty princes in awe of them. This
probably causes so many petty robberies and piracies as are
committed by the Malayans.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Being thus provoked by the Dutch, and hindered of a
free trade by their guard-ships, it is probable they therefore
commit piracies themselves, or connive at and encourage
those who do. So that the pirates seem to do it as much to
revenge themselves on the Dutch for restraining their trade,
as to gain this way what they cannot obtain in way of
traffic."</p>

<p class='c000'>So wrote Dampier, and if we go on to seventy years ago,
when Sir James Brooke commenced, unaided, that counter-move
which resulted in the salvation of the northern part of
Borneo from the then hurtful and narrow-minded rule of the
Dutch, and to its being opened to British trade and influence,
we learn from his own words "how the policy of the Dutch
has at the present day reduced this 'Eden of the Eastern
Wave' to a state of anarchy and confusion, as repugnant to
humanity as it is to commercial prosperity.... It is the
direct influence which it exerts that has proved baneful to
the Archipelago under the assumed jurisdiction of this
European power. Her unceasing interference in the concerns
of the Malay governments and the watchful fomenting of
their internal dissensions have gradually and effectually
destroyed all rightful authority, and given rise to a number
of petty states which thrive on piracy and fatten on the
slave trade. The consequent disorganisation of society
arising from these causes has placed a bar to commercial
enterprise and personal adventure, and has probably acted on
the interior tribes much in the same way as this fatal policy
has affected the Malays. As far as can be ascertained, the
financial and commercial concerns of the Dutch have not
been prosperous; it is easy to conceive such to be the case,
as it will be conceded that oppression and prosperity cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>co-exist. In short, with the smallest amount of advantage,
the Dutch Government has all along endeavoured to perpetuate
an exclusive system, aiming more at injury to others
than any advantage to themselves or to the nations under
their sway; for where an enlightened administration might
have produced the most beneficial results, we are forced to
deplore not only the mischief done and the mass of good
neglected, but the misery and suffering inflicted on unhappy
races, capable, as has been proved, of favourable development
under other circumstances."</p>

<p class='c000'>In Borneo, as elsewhere, the Malays had for long
been notorious pirates, but the Sea-Dayaks, only so far
as consisted in spasmodic raids for the acquisition of
heads.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Malay governors, now under the influence of the
Arab pseudo-sherips, diverted whole tribes of Dayaks from
their peaceable avocations, and converted them into sea-robbers.
The cultivation of their lands to produce saleable
goods, for which there was now no sale, was abandoned, and
fertile districts that had grown abundant crops were reduced
to unprofitable jungle.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it was not only on trading vessels in the China seas
that they were taught to prey. The Malay princes and
nobles sent those tribes whom they had demoralised to
ascend the rivers and plunder and exterminate the peaceful
tribes in the interior.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the tribes thus changed from an agricultural
people into pirates were the Sekrang and the Saribas.
When the Malay Muhammadan princes wanted slaves they
summoned their Dayak nominal subjects to follow them, and
led them against other tribes, either to harry the coasts
or to penetrate up the rivers ravaging; and then, from this
first stage to a second, converted them into pirates who
swept the seas, falling on trading vessels, murdering the crews,
and appropriating the plunder. According to agreement the
Malay princes received two-thirds of the spoil, and their
Dayak subjects, whom they had trained to be pirates, were
granted one-third of the plunder and all the heads they
could take.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>About this head-hunting something has been said already,
more will be said presently. As a Dayak said to a European,
"You like books, we like heads."</p>

<p class='c000'>In the latter half of the seventeenth century, the Sultan
of Bruni, Muadin, was constrained to call in the aid of his
neighbour, the Sultan of Sulu, to quell an insurrection, and
in consideration of this assistance ceded to him the land from
the north as far as the Kimanis river.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sultan Abdul Mubin had murdered his uncle, Sultan
Muhammad Ali, and usurped the throne. Pangiran Bongsu,
under the title of Sultan Muadin, with the assistance of the
Sulus, defeated Abdul Mubin, who was executed. Muhammad
Ali was murdered in 1662, and a war ensued that
lasted about twelve years.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c011'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Spaniards attacked Sulu, captured the capital, and
carried off the Sultan to Manila. When the English took
Manila, under Sir William Draper in 1762, they released
the Sultan Mumin, and he ceded the territory that had been
granted to his predecessors by the Sultan of Bruni in or
about 1674 to the East India Company, by deed signed in
1763, in consideration of an engagement entered into by
the Company to protect him from the Spaniards.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sultan Jemal ul Alam, of Bruni, who died in 1796,
married Rajah Nur Alam, daughter of his uncle Sultan
Khan Zul Alam, 21st Sultan of Bruni, by his first wife. By
her he had one legitimate son, Omar Ali Saif Udin. The
wife of Sultan Jemal had a full brother, Sri Banun Muda
(usually called Rajah Api), and also half-brothers Hasim
and Muhammad, sons of Khan Zul Alam by his second wife,
and Bedrudin and two other sons by his third wife, a Lanun
lady of rank.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the death of his grand-uncle, also grandfather, and
predecessor, Khan Zul Alam, Omar Ali was but a child, and
Rajah Api claimed the throne, under the title of Sultan
Muhammad Alam, and there were years of trouble in Bruni.
Sir Hugh Low describes him as a madman with the most
cruel propensities, whence probably his nickname Api,
which signifies "Fire." He treated his nephew with great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>roughness, and often threatened him with a drawn sword,
and Omar ran whimpering to his mother to complain. The
prince's mother had long been jealous of the assumption of
the sultanate by her brother, and, her son being almost
imbecile, she hoped, by getting rid of Api, to exercise great
power in the state. Accordingly, about the year 1828, she
summoned those of her party and surrounded the residence
of the Sultan Muhammad Alam, or Api, who finding himself
deserted escaped in a boat. His sister sent after him a
pangiran, or noble, with professions of friendship, and this
pangiran persuaded him to assume the disguise of a woman
to facilitate his escape. Then he got him into a little skiff,
and led him into an ambush, where he was ordered to be
put to death. He received the intimation with firmness.
"Observe," said he, "when you strangle me, on which side
my body shall fall—if to the right it prognosticates good
for Bruni, if to the left it foretells evil." The bow-string
was twisted, and Api sank on his left side. As we shall see
that omen proved true.</p>

<p class='c000'>Api's brother, Rajah Muda Hasim, an amiable, courteous,
feeble man, was installed as Regent; and some time later
was sent to Sarawak, where a rebellion had broken out,
caused by the exactions and cruelty of the Pangiran Makota,
who had been appointed governor of Sarawak by the Sultan.
Hasim found the whole district a prey to anarchy, and those
who should have reduced it to order were incompetent and too
cowardly to fight. All he was able to do was to maintain
a nominal sovereignty in the capital, Kuching.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Malays and Arabs being Muhammadans, looked
down on the pagan Land-Dayaks, subject to their domination,
as mere bondsmen, to be slaughtered, fleeced, or enslaved—to
be treated, in a word, as their caprice dictated,
without being taken to task for their misdeeds. The limit
of their exactions was fixed by necessity. The point
beyond which oppression ceased was that where nothing
was left to be extorted. But over the Sea-Dayaks of
Sekrang, Saribas, and Kanowit they had no power. These
tribes were far too independent in character and powerful
to submit to oppression. These Sea-Dayaks would follow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>their so-called masters on a piratical expedition, and would
obey them only so far as it pleased themselves to do so.
As to the Kayans, they were too greatly feared to be
molested. The late Mr. H. B. Low<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c011'><sup>[72]</sup></a> in 1879 was refused
permission by the Sultan to cross into the Baram by the
Limbang, for fear lest this should show the Kayans a way
into Bruni. The Malay rulers oppressed their own people
and the Melanaus almost as badly as they did the Land-Dayaks,
murdering, robbing, and enslaving them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Land-Dayaks in Sarawak were governed by local
Malay datus called Patinggi, Bandar, and Temanggong.
These officers monopolised the trade. When the Dayaks
had collected rice, edible birds' nests, wax, etc., the
Patinggi claimed the right to buy the produce at a price
fixed by himself, and one that barely allowed the seller
enough to pay for his own necessaries. And not only did
the Patinggi claim the right of pre-emption, but so did all
his relatives, and in the end so did every Bornean Malay of
any position. If the poor Dayak did not produce sufficient
to satisfy the Patinggi, girls and children were taken to
make up the deficit and sold into slavery.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c011'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>He would sometimes send a bar of iron to a headman
of a tribe, whether the latter wanted it or not, and require
him to purchase it at an exorbitant price fixed by the
sender. The man dared not refuse; then another bar was
sent, and again another, till the Dayak chief was reduced to
poverty.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a Malay met a Dayak in his boat, and the boat
pleased him, he would cut a notch in the gunwale in token
that he appropriated it to his own use. Possibly enough
some other Bornean Malay might fancy the same boat
and cut another notch. This might occur several times.
Then the Dayak was required to hand over his boat to the
first who had marked it, and to indemnify the other
claimants to the value of the vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Any injury done, or pretended to have been done, however
accidentally, by a Dayak to a Malay, had to be paid
for by a ruinous fine. There was no court of appeal, no
possibility of redress. A Malay could always, and at any
time, enter the house of a Dayak, and live there in free
quarters as long as he pleased, insult or maltreat the wife
and children of his unwilling host with impunity, and on
leaving carry away with him any of the Dayak's property
to which he had taken a fancy; and, when the novelty of
the possession wore off, force his late host to buy it back
again at an extravagant price. But this was not all. When
antimony was found, the unfortunate Land-Dayaks were
driven to mine it at no wage at all, and their hard taskmasters
did not even trouble themselves to provide them
with food.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c011'><sup>[74]</sup></a> The consequence was that many of them
died, and others fled to the jungle. As one of them
pathetically said, "We do not live like men; we are like
monkeys; we are hunted from place to place. We have no
houses, and when we light a fire we are in fear lest the
smoke should betray to our enemies where we are."</p>

<p class='c000'>Of Dayaks there are, as already stated, two sorts, the
Land-Dayak and the Sea-Dayak, the first of Indonesian, the
second of proto-Malay stock. The former are a quiet, timid,
industrious people, honest, and by no means lacking in
intelligence, living on hill-tops to which they have fled from
their oppressors; the latter throve on piracy, having been
brought to this by the Muhammadan Malays and the half-bred
Arabs. But even among the Sea-Dayaks a few tribes
had not been thus vitiated, and upon these the late Rajah
could always rely for support.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their Malay masters furnished the Sea-Dayaks, whom they
had converted into predatory savages, with ammunition and
guns, and sent them either to sea to attack merchant vessels,
or up the rivers to fall upon villages of peaceful tribes; then
the men were slaughtered, the women and children carried
off into slavery. The villages were burnt, and by a refinement
of cruelty the fruit trees cut down and standing crops
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>destroyed, from which the principal provision of the natives
was gathered, so as to reduce to starvation those who had
escaped into the jungle. Land-Dayak tribes that formerly
had been numerous and prosperous were reduced to small
numbers and to poverty. One that reckoned 230 families
dwindled to 50. Three whole tribes were completely exterminated.
One of 120 families was brought down to
two, that is to say, of 960 persons only 16 were left.
The population that had consisted of 1795 families, or,
reckoning eight persons to each family, 14,360 souls, in ten
years was reduced to 6792 souls showing a decrease in
these ten years of 946 families, or of 7568 persons. On
Sir James (then Mr.) Brooke's visit to the country in 1840,
in converse with the chief of one of the native tribes, the
man told him, "The Rajah takes from us whatever he wants,
at whatever price he pleases, and the pangirans take whatever
they can get for no price at all." "At first," says Mr.
Brooke, "the Dayak paid a small stated sum as an
acknowledgment of vassalage, by degrees this became an
arbitrary and unlimited taxation, and now, to consummate
the iniquity, the entire tribes are pronounced slaves and
liable to be disposed of."</p>

<p class='c000'>The natural result of such treatment was that those natives
who escaped spoilation and slaughter fled up the country
beyond reach of their persecutors. The depopulation from
the same cause went on in the neighbourhood of Bruni as
well as in Sarawak. Mr. Spenser St. John says in 1858:
"It is melancholy to see this fine district (Limbang), once
well cultivated, now returning to jungle; formerly where the
population extended a hundred miles beyond the last village
at present inhabited, the supply of provisions was ample at
Bruni. Now that the natives are decreasing, while Bruni is
perhaps as numerous as ever, the demands made by the
nobles are too great even for the natives' forbearance, and in
disgust they are gradually abandoning all garden cultivation.
Already brushwood is taking the place of bananas and yams,
so that few of either are to be had. The people say it is
useless for them to plant for others to eat the whole produce.
Then as the natives cannot furnish the supplies exacted of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>them by the pangirans, these latter take from them their
children; the lads are circumcised and made Mahomedans
and slaves, and the girls are drafted into the already
crowded harems of the rajahs." The same writer gives an
instance or two of the manner in which the subject natives
were treated. In 1855, the warlike Kayans of the interior
descended the Limbang river and threatened a tribe of
Muruts. The Pangiran Makota,<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c011'><sup>[75]</sup></a> virtual governor of Bruni,
met them and arranged with the chiefs that for the sum of
£700 they should spare these Muruts. Then he set those
who were menaced to collect the money. When they had
done this and placed the sum in his hands, he pocketed it
and returned to Bruni, leaving the Kayans to deal with the
tribe after their own sweet will.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, in 1857, the same head-hunters threatened
another Murut village. Makota had a secret interview with
the Kayan chiefs, and then gave out that peace had been
concluded. What he had actually done was to deliver over
to them to pillage and exterminate the Murut village of
Balal Ikan, against which he bore a grudge for having
resisted his exactions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole of the north and west of Borneo was in a
condition of indescribable wretchedness and hopelessness
when Mr. James Brooke appeared on the scene. Oppression
the most cruel and grinding, encouragement of piracy and
head-hunting by the selfish, unscrupulous pangirans sent from
Bruni, were depopulating the fair land. Sarawak, then a
very small province, was, as we shall see, in insurrection.
Single-handed, with but a comparatively small capital, the
whole of which he sank in the country, with no support from
the British Government, with no Chartered Company at his
back, he devoted his life to transform what had become
a hell into what it has become, a peaceful and happy
country.</p>

a ship wrecked many years before. When Rentap's stronghold in the Saribas was

James Brooke was
born at Benares on April
29, 1803, and was the
son of Thomas Brooke of
the East India Company's
Civil Service. He entered
the Company's army in
1819, and took part in the
first Burmese war, in which
he was severely wounded,
and from which he was invalided home in 1825. He had
been honourably mentioned in despatches for conspicuous
services rendered in having raised a much needed body of
horse, and for bravery. Then he resigned his commission,
and visited China, Penang, Malacca, and Singapore. There
he heard much of the beauty and the wonders of the
fairy group of islands forming the Eastern Archipelago,
and of the dangers to be encountered there from Malay
pirates; islands rich in all that nature could lavish in flower
and fruit, in bird and gorgeous butterfly, in diamond and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>pearl, but "the trail of the serpent was over them all."
Very little was known of these islands, few English vessels
visited them, the trade was monopolised by the Dutch, who
sought to exclude all European nations from obtaining a
foothold. They claimed thousands of islands from Sumatra
to Papua as within their exclusive sphere of influence, islands
abounding in natural products which they exploited
imperfectly, and did nothing to develop. This was a dog-in-the-manger
policy to which Great Britain submitted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young man's ambition was fired; he longed to
explore these seas, to study the natural history, the ethnology,
to discover gaps in the Dutch imaginary line through which
English commerce might penetrate and then expand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Brooke made a second voyage to the East in a brig
which, in partnership with another, he had purchased and
freighted for China; but this venture proved a failure, and the
brig and cargo were sold in China at a loss.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1835, Mr. Thomas Brooke died, leaving to his son the
sum of £30,000. James now saw that a chance was open
to him of realising his youthful dream, and he bought a yacht,
the <em>Royalist</em>, a schooner of 142 tons burden, armed with six-pounders
and several swivels, and, after a preliminary cruise
in the Mediterranean to train his crew, he sailed in December
1838, flying the flag of the Royal Yacht Squadron, for that
enchanted group of islands—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>Those islands of the sea</div>
      <div class='line'>Where Nature rises to Fame's highest round.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c011'><sup>[78]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And as he wrote, to cast himself on the waters, like
Southey's little book; but whether the world would know
him after many days, was a question which, hoping the
best, he could not answer with any degree of assurance.</p>

<p class='c000'>He arrived in Singapore in May, 1839. The Rajah
Muda Hasim of Sarawak had recently shown kind treatment
to some English shipwrecked sailors, and Mr.
Brooke was commissioned by the Governor and the
Singapore Chamber of Commerce to convey letters of thanks
and presents to the Rajah Muda in acknowledgment of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>humanity, exceptional in those days, and a marked contrast
to the treatment afforded to the crew and passengers of the
Sultana a little later by his sovereign, the Sultan of Bruni,
which is recorded further on.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c011'><sup>[79]</sup></a> This chance diverted Mr.
Brooke from his original project of going to Marudu Bay, the
place he had indicated as being the best adapted for the
establishment of a British settlement, and took him to the
field of his life-long labours.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>"ROYALIST" OFF SANTUBONG.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>He left Singapore on July 27, 1839, full of hope and
confidence that something was to be done, and reaching the
West Coast of Borneo surveyed some seventy miles of that
coast before entering the Sarawak river, which was not then
marked on the charts; for of Borneo at that time very little
was known; its interior was a blank upon the maps, and its
coast was set down by guess work on the Admiralty charts;
so much so, that Mr. Brooke found Cape Datu placed some
seventy to eighty miles too far to the east and north, and
he was "obliged to clip some hundreds of miles of habitable
land off the charts."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Kuching,<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c011'><sup>[80]</sup></a> the capital of Sarawak, is so called from a
small stream that runs through the town into the main river,
that a few miles below expands and forms a delta of many
channels and mouths. The town, which is seated some
twenty miles from the open sea, was founded by Pangiran
Makota, when Bruni rule was established in Sarawak, and he
was sent down as the Sultan's representative a few years
previously to the arrival of Mr. Brooke. At this time the
population, with the exception of a few Chinese traders and
other eastern foreigners, consisted entirely of Bruni Malays
to the number of about 800. The Sarawak Malays lived at
Katupong,<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c011'><sup>[81]</sup></a> a little higher up, and farther up again at Leda
Tanah, under their head chief, the brave Datu Patinggi Ali.</p>

<p class='c000'>A distinction must be made, which it will be as well to again
note here, between the Malays of Bruni and those of Sarawak,
in other works described—the former as Borneans, and the
latter as Siniawans. They are very different in appearance,
manners, and even in language. There are not many Brunis
in Sarawak now. Most returned to their own country with
Rajah Muda Hasim when he retired there in 1844, and
others drifted thither later. All the Malays in Kuching,
except a sprinkling of foreigners, are Sarawak Malays, the
descendants of the so-called Siniawans.</p>

<p class='c013'>The bay that lies between Capes Datu and Sipang is indeed a
lovely one. To the right lies the splendid range of Poé, over-topping
the lower, but equally beautiful, Gading hills; then the
fantastic-shaped mountains of the interior; while to the left the
range of Santubong end-on towards you looks like a solitary peak,
rising as an island from the sea, as Teneriffe once appeared to me
sailing by in the <em>Mæander</em>. From these hills flow many streams
which add to the beauty of the view. But the gems of the scene are
the little emerald isles that are scattered over the surface of the bay,
presenting their pretty beaches of glittering sand, or their lovely
foliage drooping to kiss the rippling waves. There is no prettier
spot (than the mouth of the Sarawak river); on the right bank rises
the splendid peak of Santubong, over 2000 feet in height,<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c011'><sup>[82]</sup></a> clothed
from its summit to its base with noble vegetation, its magnificent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>buttresses covered with lofty trees, showing over a hundred feet of
stem without a branch, and at its base a broad beach of white sand
fringed by graceful casuarinas, waving and trembling under the influence
of the faintest breeze, and at that time thronged by wild hogs.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c011'><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On August 15, the <em>Royalist</em> cast anchor off the capital, and
Mr. Brooke had an interview with the Rajah Muda, presented
the letters and gifts, and was very graciously received. He
was allowed to make excursions to Lundu, Samarahan, and
Sadong, large rivers hitherto unknown to Europeans, and he
added some seventy miles to his survey of the coast; but as
the Malays and most of the Dayak tribes were in insurrection
in the interior, travelling there was unsafe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah Muda Hasim, the Bandahara of Bruni and
the heir-presumptive to the throne, was a plain, middle-aged
man, with gracious and courtly manners, amiable and well
disposed, but weak and indolent. He was placed in a
difficult position, which he had not the energy or the ability
to fill. The Sultan of Bruni had confided the district of
Sarawak some years previously to the Pangiran Makota as
governor, a man utterly unprincipled, grasping, selfish, cruel,
and cowardly, but "the most mild, the most gentlemanly
rascal you can conceive";<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c011'><sup>[84]</sup></a> and by his exactions and by forced
labour at the antimony mines, he had driven the Sarawak
Malays, as well as the Land-Dayaks, into open revolt. They
proclaimed their independence of Bruni, and asserted that
submission to the Sultan had been voluntary on their part,
and on stipulated conditions that had not been carried out.
For three years they had carried on their struggle against
the Bruni tyrants, but, though far from being reduced, it
became evident to them that unaided they could not attain
their freedom. Surrender meant death to the chiefs and
abject slavery to the people, and to their womankind something
far worse than either, so in their extremity they
appealed to the Dutch. A year before Mr. Brooke's arrival
they had invited the Dutch to plant the Netherlands flag in
their camp, and afterwards had sent an emissary to Batavia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>to beg the assistance of the Governor-General, but open
assistance was refused, though the Sultan of Sambas appears
to have constantly supplied the rebels with ammunition and
provisions. As Mr. Brooke had warned the Pangiran
Makota, who had reason to fear Dutch aggression, the
danger was not an open violation of their independence, but
their coming on friendly terms—they might make war after
having first gained a footing, not before. The Dutch had made
great efforts to establish trade with Sarawak, in other words,
to monopolise it, and through their vassal, the Sultan of
Sambas, had offered assistance to open the antimony mines.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sultan of Bruni had sent his uncle, the Rajah Muda
Hasim, to reduce the rebels, but without withdrawing Makota
and checking his abuse of authority. A desultory war had
been carried on without success under the direction of Makota,
who was too cowardly himself to lead his Malay and Dayak
levies into action, to storm the stockades of the insurgents,
and to pursue them to their strongholds. The consequence
was that anarchy prevailed, except in the immediate neighbourhood
of the capital.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was something in the frank eye, in the cheery self-confidence
of Brooke that captivated the timid little Rajah
Muda, who was not only unable to cope with the Malays
in revolt, but was afraid of his neighbours, the Dutch, lest
they should make the disturbances an excuse for intervention
and annexation, and he hoped in his extremity to obtain
some help from the British.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Which is the cat and which is the mouse?" he asked
in reference to the rival powers. "Britain is unquestionably
the mouser," replied Brooke. But he did not add that the
mouser was so gorged and lazy as only occasionally to stretch
forth a paw.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Brooke bade his friends good-bye on September 20,
after having received a pressing invitation from the Rajah
Muda to revisit him, and he begged Brooke not to forget
him. Leaving the <em>Royalist</em> at Muaratebas, Brooke visited
the Sadong river, where he made the acquaintance of Sherip
Sahap,<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c011'><sup>[85]</sup></a> a powerful half-bred Arab chief and ruler of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>river, who in later days was to give Brooke so much trouble.
He returned to the <em>Royalist</em> on the 27th, and intended to
sail the next morning, but was delayed by a startling
incident that gave him his first experience of the piratical
habits of the Saribas Dayaks. The boat of Penglima Rajah
(the Rajah's captain), who was to pilot the <em>Royalist</em> over the
bar, and which was lying inshore of the yacht, was attacked
in the middle of the night, but the report of a gun and the
display of a blue light from the yacht caused the Dayaks to
decamp hurriedly, though not before they had seriously
wounded the Penglima and three of his crew. Mr. Brooke
waited until the wounded were sufficiently recovered to be
sent to Kuching, and, after he had paid a flying visit to that
place at the urgent request of the Rajah, sailed for Singapore
on October 3.</p>

<p class='c000'>The history of his late cruise, to quote Mr. Brooke, had
agitated the society in Singapore, and whilst the merchants
presented him with an address of thanks, the Governor
became cooler towards him. The former foresaw an access
of trade, the latter was nervous of political embarrassments.</p>

<p class='c013'><em>He</em> would fain have me lay aside all politics, but whilst I see
such treachery and baseness on one part (the Dutch), and such
weakness, imbecility, and indifference on the other (the English),
I will continue to upraise my voice at fitting seasons. I will not
leave my native friends to be deceived and betrayed by either white
nation, and (what the governor does not like) I will speak bold
truths to native ears.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dutch trading regulations weighed on this island
as they did on all others within their influence. Sir
Stamford Raffles, in his <cite>History of Java</cite>, 1830, tells us that
by an edict of 1767, trading in opium, pepper, and all
spices was prohibited in the Archipelago to all persons
under <em>pain of death</em>, and other severe penalties were imposed
upon those trading in other commodities. The quantity
of gunpowder and shot that might be carried by any vessel
was restricted, and the punishment for carrying more than
was permitted was the confiscation of the vessel and corporal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>punishment. Vessels were not allowed to sail from any
part of the Java coast where there was not a Company's
Resident. Those from Banka and Beliton could only
trade to Palembang (Sumatra). Navigation from Celebes
and Sumbawa was prohibited under pain of confiscation
of vessel and cargo. The China junks were permitted to
trade at Batavia and Banjermasin alone. In all there were
thirty-one articles of restriction, "serving to shackle every
movement of commerce, and to extinguish every spirit of
enterprise, for the narrow, selfish purposes of what may be
called the fanaticism of gain." The consequence was that
honest traffic was paralysed, and an opportunity and indirect
encouragement given to piracy. Indeed, the Dutch
winked at this as it hampered smuggling by European and
native traders. They resented it only when their own trade
was interfered with by the marauders.</p>

<p class='c000'>After visiting the Celebes, where he spent four months,
Mr. Brooke sailed for Sarawak from Singapore on August
18, 1840. His kindly feeling for the Rajah Muda Hasim
prompted him to pay another visit to Sarawak, taking it
on his way to Manila and China. He found the condition
of the country as distracted as ever, "with no probability
of any termination of a state of affairs so adverse to every
object which I had in view," and so decided to quit the
scene and proceed on his voyage. On notifying his
departure to the Rajah, he was urgently pressed to remain;
every topic was exhausted to excite his compassion. The
Rajah laid his difficulties before him, and expressed "his
resolution to die here rather than abandon his undertaking—to
die deserted and disgraced"; and it was compassion
for his miserable situation that induced Mr. Brooke to alter
his intention.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rebellion had lasted for nearly four years, and for
the efforts made to quell it might well last for a century,
and the whole country, except Kuching, become independent.
Starvation had compelled many of the Land-Dayaks to
submit, but that was the only advantage that had been
gained. Hasim was in ill odour at Bruni because he had
effected nothing, and the Orang Kaya di Gadong, a Bruni
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>minister, had been sent by the Sultan to stir him up to
greater activity. But how to exert himself, how with
cowardly pangirans to come to close quarters with the
rebels he could not see, and in his helplessness and discouragement
he caught at the opportunity offered by the
arrival of Brooke.</p>

<p class='c000'>With some reluctance Mr. Brooke consented to assist
Hasim against the insurgents, and proceeded to Siniawan;
but after having been up-river a short time he returned
to Kuching, disgusted by the supineness and inertness
of Makota and the other leaders, and announced
his intention of sailing for Manila. Hasim saw that
Brooke's departure would deprive him of his last chance
of reducing the rebels, and that he would have to return to
Bruni in disgrace. Again he urged Brooke to stay, and
he offered him the country if he would return up-river and
take command of his forces. "He offered me," wrote
Brooke, "the country of Siniawan and Sarawak, with its
government and trade;" in addition he offered to grant
him the title of Rajah.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hasim had been placed in Sarawak for a purpose,
which he was wholly unable to effect; as he was heir-presumptive<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c011'><sup>[86]</sup></a>
to the throne of Bruni, he was impatient at
what he considered his exile from the capital. Could the
insurrection be subdued he would be reinstated in the
favour of his nephew, and might return to Bruni to defeat the
machinations of his enemies there, leaving the government
of Sarawak in the strong hands of Brooke.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Brooke hesitated for some time, as the offer
had been imposed by necessity, but finally agreed, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>promised the assistance required. With ten of his English
crew and two guns, he joined the Rajah's mixed force
of Malays, Dayaks, and Chinese, and proceeded against
the insurgents. As was their wont, the pangirans in
command hung back and would not expose their precious
persons to danger, with the notable exception of the
Pangiran Bedrudin, half-brother to the Rajah Muda Hasim.
This was Brooke's first meeting with Bedrudin. He
was greatly impressed with his frank but overawing and
stately demeanour, and a warm friendship soon sprang up
between them, which lasted until the death of this ill-fated
prince, who justly earned a reputation for bravery and
constancy, the only one of the royal princes of Bruni in
whom these qualities were combined.</p>

<p class='c000'>To Mr. Brooke's regret, Bedrudin was shortly withdrawn
by his brother, and the other pangirans, led by Makota,
thwarted him in every forward movement, to disguise their
own cowardice. Finally, after several bloodless engagements
and bombardments, communication was opened with Sherip
Mat Husain,<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c011'><sup>[87]</sup></a> one of the rebel leaders, and he came to see
Mr. Brooke under a flag of truce, which would have received
little respect had it not been for the stern measures taken
by the latter. This meeting led to an interview between
the Malay rebel chiefs and Mr. Brooke, and they submitted,
but only on the understanding that Brooke was henceforth
to be the Rajah, and that he would restrain the oppression
of the pangirans. On these terms they laid down their arms,
and then it was with great difficulty that Brooke succeeded
in wringing from the Rajah Muda a consent that their lives
should be spared, and that consent was only reluctantly given
on Brooke rising up to bid the Rajah Muda farewell; but
the wives and children of the principal chiefs, to the number
of over one hundred, were taken from them by Hasim as
hostages. They "were treated with kindness and preserved
from injury or wrong."<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c011'><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Some delay ensued in the investiture of Brooke with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>governorship. Hasim was disposed to shuffle, and Makota,
who feared his exactions would be interfered with, used all
his power to prevent it. Hoping it would content Brooke,
the Rajah Muda had drawn up an agreement which was only
to the purport that he was to reside in Sarawak in order to
seek for profit, an agreement which the Rajah Muda explained
was merely to be shown to the Sultan in the first place, and
that it was not intended as a substitute for that which
had been agreed upon between themselves, and would be
granted in due course. Hasim was between two stools: his
duty in respect to his promise to Brooke, whose friendship and
support were necessary to him; and his fear of the party led
by Makota in Sarawak, but still more powerfully represented
in Bruni, who foresaw, as well as he did himself, the end
of their rule of tyranny if once such an advocate for reform
as Mr. Brooke were allowed to gather up the reins of power.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brooke accepted this equivocal arrangement, and, trusting
in the Rajah Muda's good faith, to establish trade and communication
with Singapore, went to the expense of buying
and freighting the schooner <em>Swift</em> of ninety tons with a
general cargo. On her arrival from Singapore the Rajah
Muda took over the whole cargo, promising antimony ore in
exchange, but this promise also he showed no intention
of fulfilling—in fact it never was fulfilled. After this cargo
had been obtained the Rajah Muda became cool to Brooke,
evaded all discussion about the settlement of the country,
and even went so far as to deny that he had ever made the
unsolicited promise to transfer the government to him; and
a plot was attempted to involve him in a dispute with the
Dutch at Sambas.</p>

<p class='c000'>To ruin Mr. Brooke's prestige with the Land-Dayaks,
Malays, and Chinese, as their protector, a crafty scheme was
devised by Makota, to which he induced the Rajah to grant
his consent. He invited a party of 2500 Sea-Dayaks from
Sekrang to ascend the Sarawak river and massacre the
Land-Dayaks, Malays, and Chinese in the interior. They
arrived at Kuching, and, with the addition of a number
of Malays as guides, started up the river. But Brooke,
highly incensed, retired to the <em>Royalist</em>, and at once prepared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>that vessel and the <em>Swift</em> for action. This had the
desired effect. Hasim was cowed; "he denied all knowledge
of it; but the knowledge was no less certain, and the
measure his own."<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c011'><sup>[89]</sup></a> He threw the blame on Makota, and,
yielding to Brooke's insistence, sent a messenger up river
after the fleet to recall it,—a command that could not be
disobeyed, as Brooke held command of the route by which
they must return. Sulkily and resentfully did the Sekrang
Dayaks return, without heads, and without plunder. And
for Makota it was a case of the biter bit, as he had unwittingly
enhanced Brooke's prestige. The oppressed people
now learnt that Brooke was not only determined to protect
them, but that he had the power to do it—a power greater
than Makota's; and this strengthened his hands, for many
who had wavered through doubt on this point and fear of
Makota, now threw in their lot with him, as Makota was
shortly to discover to his cost.</p>

<p class='c013'>"The very idea," wrote Brooke in his Journal, "of letting
2500 wild devils loose in the interior of the country is horrible.
What object can the Malays<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c011'><sup>[90]</sup></a> have in destroying their own country
and people so wantonly? The Malays take part in these excursions,
and thirty men joined the Sekrangs on the present occasion, and
consequently they share the plunder, and share largely. Probably
Muda Hasim would have twenty slaves (women and children), and
these twenty being redeemed at the low rate of twenty reals each
makes 400 reals, besides other plunder amounting to one or two hundred
reals more. Inferior pangirans would, of course, take likewise."</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Brooke had now been put off for five months, and
for six weeks had withdrawn from all intercourse with
Rajah Muda Hasim. As he wrote, "I have done this man
many benefits; and, if he prove false after all his promises,
I will put that mark of shame upon him that death would be
lighter." This was no idle threat, for he sent a final demand
to the Rajah Muda either to perform his promise or to repay
him all his outlay, and a warning that should Hasim do
neither he would take sure means to make him; and the
means were at hand, for on his return from Singapore Mr.
Brooke had found the people of Sarawak again at issue with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>their ruler, and had once more thrown off their allegiance
to the Sultan. They then offered him that allegiance,
and their support to drive Rajah Muda Hasim and his
followers out of the country; this offer was, however,
declined. But a circumstance occurred that precipitated
matters. Makota attempted to poison Brooke's interpreter
by mixing arsenic with his rice. Through the indiscretion of
a subordinate the plot was discovered, and Brooke immediately
laid the facts before the Rajah Muda, as well as "a little
treasury" of grievances and crimes against Makota, and demanded
an inquiry. "The demand, as usual, was met by
vague promises of future investigation, and Makota seemed to
triumph in the success of his villainy, but the moment for
action had now arrived, and my conscience told me that I
was bound no longer to submit to such injustice, and I was
resolved to test the strength of our respective parties."<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c011'><sup>[91]</sup></a>
The <em>Royalist's</em> guns were loaded, and her broadside brought
to bear, and Mr. Brooke landed with a small armed party.
He demanded and immediately obtained an audience, and
pointed out Makota's tyranny and oppression of all classes,
and his determination to attack him, and drive him out of
the country. Not a single man upheld Makota, whilst the
Malays rallied around Mr. Brooke. This was a test of public
opinion to which Makota had to bow, and he was deposed
from his governorship. Mr. Brooke's public installation
immediately followed, the Rajah Muda Hasim informing
the people that he was henceforth to rule over them. On
the 24th of September, 1841, a memorable day in the history
not only of Sarawak but of the whole of North-Western
Borneo, he was declared Rajah and Governor of Sarawak,
amidst the roar of cannon and a general display of flags and
banners on the shore and the vessels on the river.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c011'><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On that day he became Rajah of Sarawak, though a
feudatory Rajah, a position which he was not content to
hold for long, as such a position would have proved
untenable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sarawak was then of very limited extent; it was a little
governorship extending from Cape Datu to the mouth of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Sadong, and included, besides smaller streams, the Lundu,
Sarawak, and Samarahan rivers; and this district, about
3000 square miles in area, is, with the inclusion of the
Sadong river, now known as Sarawak Proper. In the days
of Hasim Sarawak was not a raj, but a province under a
governor. Hasim was not actually the Rajah of Sarawak,
though his high birth gave him the right to the courtesy title
of Rajah. His real title was the Pangiran Muda;<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c011'><sup>[93]</sup></a> Muda
is inseparable from the title, and was not a part of his name.
Pangiran Muda, the heir to the throne, is the correct Bruni
title. Rajah Muda (young Rajah) also means heir-apparent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The districts from Sarawak up to Bintulu, and beyond,
formed separate provinces, and were under separate governors,
but Hasim's high rank naturally gave him some influence
over these officials. Sadong was governed by Sherip
Sahap, his subjects being Land-Dayaks; his power, however,
extended to the head of that river. Sherip Japar of
Lingga, Sherip Mular of Sekrang, and Sherip Masahor of
Serikei, held nominal authority only over the main population
of their respective districts occupied by the Sea-Dayaks, for
these people acknowledged no government, and lived in
independence even in the vicinity of the Malays. Such,
moreover, was the case with the Saribas, which was nominally
governed by Malay chiefs. The districts of Muka, Oya, and
Bintulu were under Bruni pangirans, but, having only
Melanaus to govern, their control was complete. In the
Baram, a river inhabited by warlike Kayans and Kenyahs,
the Malays, nominal rulers and traders, lived on sufferance
alone, and so it was in the Sea-Dayak countries of the
Batang Lupar, Saribas, and Rejang. Over the Malays, the
Land-Dayaks, and the Melanaus, the Bruni Government had
power—the Sea-Dayaks and Kayans scorned it. The
sherips, as the title denotes, are of Arab origin, and they
claim descent from the Prophet. They are half-breeds, and
were dangerous men. Earl, in his <cite>Eastern Seas</cite>, 1837,
says:—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>"The pirates who infest the Archipelago consist wholly of the
free Mahomedan states in Sumatra, Lingin, Borneo, Magindano,
and Sulu (and he should have added of the Malay Peninsula),
those natives who have remained uncontaminated by the detestable
doctrines of the Arabs, never being known to engage in like
pursuits."</p>

<p class='c000'>Again:—</p>

<p class='c013'>The genuine Arabs are often high-minded, enterprising men,
but their half-caste descendants who swarm in the Archipelago comprise
the most despicable set of wretches in existence. Under the
name of religion they have introduced among the natives the vilest
system of intolerance and wickedness imaginable; and those places
in which they have gained an ascendency<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c011'><sup>[94]</sup></a> are invariably converted
into dens of infamy and piracy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Stamford Raffles says "they are commonly nothing
better than manumitted slaves, and they hold like robbers
the offices they obtain as sycophants, and cover all with the
sanctimonious veil of religious hypocrisy."</p>

<p class='c000'>And such were the sherips of Borneo with whom the
English Rajah had to deal, and whose power he eventually
broke. There are many of these to this day in Sarawak,
but they have been converted into harmless members of the
community, and some have been good Government officials,
notably Sherip Putra, who died in June, 1906, after having
served the Government well and faithfully for twenty-two
years; and he was the son of Sherip Sahap, and the nephew
of Sherip Mular.</p>

<p class='c000'>The condition of the country on Rajah Brooke's accession
is best described in his own words. After relating the
devastations committed by the piratical and head-hunting
Dayaks of Saribas and Sekrang, the Rajah goes on to say:—</p>

<p class='c013'>It is of the hill Dayaks,<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c011'><sup>[95]</sup></a> however, I would particularly write, for a
more wretched, oppressed race is not to be found, or one more
deserving the commiseration of the humane. Though industrious
they never reap what they sow; though their country is rich in
produce, they are obliged to yield it all to their oppressors; though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>yielding all beyond their bare sustenance, they rarely can preserve
half <em>their children</em>, and often—too often—are robbed of them all,
with their wives.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c011'><sup>[96]</sup></a> All that rapacity and oppression can effect is
exhausted, and the only happiness that ever falls to the lot of these
unhappy tribes is getting one tyrant instead of five thousand. Indeed,
it is quite useless to try to explain the miserable condition of this
country, where for the last ten years there has been no government;
where intrigue and plunder form the occupation of all the higher
classes; where a poor man to possess beyond his clothes is a crime;
where lying is a virtue, religion dead, and where cheating is so
common; and last, where the ruler, Muda Hasim, is so weak, that
he has lost all authority except in name and observance.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/p076.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>LAND-DAYAK VILLAGE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And further:—</p>

<p class='c013'>All those who frequent the sea-shore lead a life of constant peril
from roving Dayaks and treacherous Malays, and Illanuns and
Balaninis, the regular pirates. It is a life of watchfulness, hide-and-seek,
and fight or flight, and in the course of each year many lose
their lives or their liberty.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is the country I have taken upon myself to govern with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>small means, few men, and, in short, without any of the requisites
which could insure success; I have distraction within and intrigue
abroad, and I have the weakest of the weak,<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c011'><sup>[97]</sup></a> a rotten staff to depend
upon for my authority.</p>

<p class='c000'>To add to his troubles, the season was one of famine
following on intestine troubles. So poor were the people, that,
again to quote the Rajah: "daily, poor wretches in the last
stage of starvation float down the river, and crawl to my
house to beg a little, little rice."</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the first acts of the Rajah was to obtain the
return to their families of the women and children of the
late rebel Malay chiefs, who had been detained by Hasim
now for nine months. He then recalled the Sarawak Malays,
who, after submission to Hasim, had retired with their chiefs
to distant parts, not trusting the good faith of their Malay
Rajah and his right-hand man, Makota. The Bruni datus
appointed by the former Governor were displaced, and the
old Sarawak Malay datus, who had been in rebellion against
the Bruni Government, and who owed their lives to Rajah
Brooke's intercession, were reinstated, and in their families
the offices remain to this day. Who these chiefs were at
that time there seems to exist some doubt, with the exception
of the premier datu, the Datu Patinggi Ali, who fell gallantly
fighting for the Government three years after he had been
reinstated, and the Datu Temanggong Mersal. The old
Datu Bandar, Rancha, had died before this, and no one
appears to have succeeded him directly, but Datu Patinggi
Ali's son-in-law, Haji Abdul Gapur, and his son Muhammad
Lana, evidently held office of some kind as native chiefs.
On the Datu Patinggi's death, Haji Gapur succeeded him in
office, and Muhammad Lana became the Datu Bandar. When
Haji Gapur was dismissed in 1854, another son of the Datu
Patinggi Ali, Haji Bua Hasan, was made the Imaum, and a
few years afterwards Datu Imaum, but no one was then, or
has since been, appointed to the office of Datu Patinggi.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Muhammad Lana's death, his brother Haji Bua
Hasan became Datu Bandar, and, shortly afterwards, another
relative, Haji Abdul Karim, was appointed Datu Imaum, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>he was succeeded on his death in 1877 by Haji Muhammad
Taim, the youngest son of the Datu Patinggi Ali. The Datu
Bandar, Haji Bua Hasan, died in harness in 1905, over one
hundred years of age, and has been succeeded by his son,
Muhammad Kasim, formerly the Datu Muda; another son,
Haji Muhammad Ali, is the Datu Hakim. These offices are
not hereditary, so this narration will show how well the family
of gallant old Patinggi Ali, the direct descendant of the
original founder of Sarawak, Rajah Jarom, with the sole
exception of Haji Gapur, have earned and retained the
confidence of the Government, and how honourably they
have maintained their position.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Datu Temanggong Mersal belonged to another
family, but he and his sons were not the less staunch; the
eldest, brave Abang Pata, rendered the Government very
signal services, and the younger, Muhammad Hasan, succeeded
his father as Temanggong.</p>

<p class='c000'>The only one who betrayed the trust reposed in him was
the Datu Patinggi Haji Gapur. Of him, as well as the
others, we shall hear more in the sequel.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the same time that the old chiefs were reinstated
the Rajah instituted a Court of Justice, in which he presided,
and was assisted in dispensing justice by the brothers of
Rajah Muda Hasim, and he promulgated the following simple
laws, of which this is a summary:—</p>

<p class='c013'>James Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak, makes known to all men the
following regulations:—</p>

<p class='c012'>1. That murder, robbery, and other heinous crimes will be
punished according to the written laws of Borneo;<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c011'><sup>[98]</sup></a> and
no man committing such offences will escape, if, after fair
inquiry, he be found guilty.</p>

<p class='c012'>2. All men, whether Malays, Chinese, or Dayaks are permitted
to trade or to labour according to their pleasure, and to
enjoy their gains.</p>

<p class='c012'>3. All roads will be open, and all boats coming from other parts
are free to enter the river and depart without let or
hindrance.</p>

<p class='c012'>4. Trade, in all its branches, will be free, with the exception of
antimony ore, which the Governor holds in his own hands,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>but which no person is forced to work, and which will be
paid for at a proper price when obtained.</p>

<p class='c012'>5. It is ordered that no persons going amongst the Dayaks shall
disturb them or gain their goods under false pretences.
The revenue will be collected by the three Datus bearing
the seal of the Governor, and (except this yearly demand
from the Government) they are to give nothing to any
other person; nor are they obliged to sell their goods
except they please, and at their own prices.</p>

<p class='c012'>6. The revenue shall be fixed, so that every one may know
certainly how much he has to contribute yearly to support
the Government.</p>

<p class='c012'>7. Weights and measures shall be settled and money current in
the country, and doits<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c011'><sup>[99]</sup></a> introduced, that the poor may
purchase food cheaply.</p>

<p class='c012'>8. Obedience to the ordinances will be strictly enforced.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah's next step was to redress some of the wrongs
to which the unhappy people had been subjected, and by
ameliorating their condition to gain their confidence. The
Rajah Muda Hasim and his brothers were in his way, "and
the intriguing, mean, base Brunis, who depended upon the
support of the pangirans to escape punishment when guilty;"<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c011'><sup>[100]</sup></a>
but, nevertheless, at the end of the year he was able to write
that he had done much good—that he had saved the lives of
many people, restored many captives to their families, and
freed many slaves from bondage, and above all, that he had
repressed vice, and had assisted the distressed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah had also to safeguard his country; to
prepare to take the offensive against the Malays and
Sea-Dayaks of the Sekrang and Saribas; and to guard
against the plots and designs of his neighbours the sherips,
who viewed with no friendly eye the establishment of
a government in Sarawak, having as its principal objects the
suppression of piracy and lawlessness. It was a menace to
them, and they knew it, and to retain their power they were
prepared to go to any length. Already Sherip Sahap and his
brother Sherip Mular had sent people against the Sempro
and Sentah Dayaks; and the former had endeavoured to
withdraw the allegiance of the datus from the Rajah, but in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>this he failed. As a defensive measure the Rajah built a
fort and palisaded his little town. He also constructed
war-boats for the protection of the coast, and to take the
offensive, which he saw must be inevitable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah soon showed the Saribas the power of his
arm. Thirteen of their large war-boats appeared off the
coast on a piratical cruise, and these were met and attacked
by three of the Rajah's well-armed boats and driven
back with heavy loss. Retaliation was threatened, and the
Dayaks prepared, but it was a long time before they again
appeared, and the terror of Brooke's name kept them off
Sarawak. At this time Sherip Sahap also received a lesson.
He had sent a Pangiran Bedrudin to Kuching on a secret
mission, and the pangiran on his way down river fell in with
and attacked a Chinese boat, wounding two of the crew, one
mortally. The Rajah immediately gave chase, and after
eight days came up with them. One of the pangiran's crew,
a Lanun penglima, amoked, but was killed by the Datu
Patinggi Ali before he could do any harm; the rest
surrendered, and were taken to Kuching, where the pangiran,
and another, a relation of his, were executed, and the crew
imprisoned.</p>

<p class='c000'>A month later, two Singgi Dayak chiefs, Pa Rimbun and
Pa Tumo, for killing Segu Dayaks within the State, were
arrested and executed. These examples showed his neighbours
that the Rajah was determined to protect his people;
and it showed the people that the law would be administered
with an equal and firm hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as yet the ratification of his appointment had not
been made, and on July 14th, 1842, the Rajah left for Bruni
to obtain from the Sultan the confirmation of his nomination
by Hasim, and to effect, if possible, a reconciliation between
the Sultan and his uncle, as he was naturally desirous to get
the latter, his brothers, and their Bruni followers, away from
Sarawak, so as to give stability to the Government, and to
prevent a needless drain upon the treasury. Another object
the Rajah had in view was to obtain the release of about
twenty-five Lascars belonging to an English ship, the <em>Lord
Melbourne</em>, which had lately been wrecked, and who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>found their way to Bruni, where they were being detained in
captivity.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it happened, another English ship, the <em>Sultana</em>, had
about eighteen months previously been wrecked on the
N.W. coast, struck by lightning, and the captain, his wife, two
passengers, one a lady, and some English seamen, had
escaped to Bruni in the long boat; the Lascars had landed
farther north, and had been captured and sold into slavery
by Sherip Usman. The Sultan seized these unfortunate
people, and robbed them of their money, some jewels, and
their boat. He further compelled them to sign bonds to
himself for considerable sums of money, and he had treated
them with harshness and inhumanity.</p>

<img src='images/p081.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>LAND-DAYAK HEAD-HOUSE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>On hearing of this Mr. Brooke had sent his yacht, the
<em>Royalist</em>, to Bruni to obtain their release, but this had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>refused by the Sultan, and then he communicated with
Singapore. The East India Company's Steamer <em>Diana</em> was
despatched to Bruni, ran up the river and pointed its guns on
the palace. The Sultan was so thoroughly alarmed that he
surrendered the captives, after a detention of eight months,
and the dread of the "fire-ship" remained on him, so that
when the Rajah arrived he was in a compliant mood, and
received him most cordially.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be as well here to give a description of Bruni
and of its Court.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Bruni river flows into a noble bay, across which to
the north lies the island of Labuan. Above the town the
river is very small, and rises but some fifteen to twenty
miles inland. Where the town is, the river is very broad,
forming a large lake. The town is commanded by hills
once under cultivation; on an island at the mouth of the
entrance are the shattered remains of an old Portuguese fort,
which was still standing, though ruinous, when Hunt visited
the place in 1809. The town itself has been designated
the "Venice of Borneo" by old writers, a description to
which the Italian Beccari rightly objected,<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c011'><sup>[101]</sup></a> and is mainly
built on piles driven into the mud on a shallow in the
middle of the lake, the houses occupying wooden platforms
elevated some ten feet above the reach of the tide.
Communication between them is effected by canoes, in
which the women daily go through the town selling
provisions. It is, in a word, similar to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">palafitte</span>
villages found in prehistoric times in the lakes of Switzerland
and Lombardy. A part of the town, including the
houses of the Sultan and the wazirs, is situated on the left
bank of the river. It is the Bruni of Pigafetta's time,
though sadly reduced in size and importance. Then the
Sultan's palace was enclosed by a strong brick wall,<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c011'><sup>[102]</sup></a> with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>barbicans mounting fifty-six cannon, now it is but a roughly
built barn-like shed. Gone are the richly caparisoned
elephants, and gone too is all the old pride, pomp, and
panoply, including the spoons of gold, which particularly
struck the old voyager.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c011'><sup>[103]</sup></a> Bruni has no defences now, but, at
the period of which we are writing, there were batteries
planted on each side of the inlet commanding the approach,
also two forts on the heights, and one battery on a tongue
of land that looked down the estuary, and which could rake
a fleet advancing towards the town, whilst the batteries
on the two banks poured in a flank fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the tide goes out the mud is most offensive to
European nostrils, as all the filth and offal is cast into it
from the platforms, and left there to decompose. The town
at the time of the Rajah's visit, was in a condition of squalid
wretchedness—the buildings, all of wood and leaf matting,
were in a tumbledown state; and the population was mainly
composed of slaves and the hangers on of the Sultan, the
nobles, and other members of the upper classes. The Sultan
was a man past fifty years of age, short and puffy in person,
with a countenance indicative of imbecility. In his journal
the Rajah wrote:</p>

<p class='c013'>His right hand is garnished with an extra diminutive thumb,
the natural member being crooked and distorted.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c011'><sup>[104]</sup></a> His mind, indexed
by his face, seems to be a chaos of confusion, without
dignity and without good sense. He can neither read nor write, is
guided by the last speaker; and his advisers, as might be expected,
are of the lower order, and mischievous from their ignorance and
their greediness. He is always talking, and generally joking; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>the most serious subjects never meet with five minutes' consecutive
attention. His rapacity is carried to such an excess as to astonish
a European, and is evinced in a thousand mean ways. The presents
I made him were unquestionably handsome, but he was not content
without begging from me the share I had reserved for the other
pangirans; and afterwards solicited mere trifles such as sugar, pen-knives,
and the like. To crown all he was incessantly asking what
was left in the vessel, and when told the truth—that I was stripped
bare as a tree in winter—he frequently returned to the charge.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Court at Bruni consisted of the Pangiran Mumin,
the Sultan's uncle by marriage, a fairly well-disposed man,
though a friend of Makota, but of no ability, avaricious, and
with the mind of a huckster, who afterwards became Sultan.
There were several uncles of the Sultan, but they were
devoid of influence, and were mostly absent in Sarawak,
whereas the Pangiran Usup, an illegitimate son of Sultan
Muhammad Tejudin, and consequently a left-handed uncle
to the reigning Sultan,—a man crafty, unscrupulous, and
ambitious,—held sway over the mind of his nephew, and
induced him to look with suspicion on his uncles of
legitimate birth. This man was in league with the pirates,
and a determined opponent of British interference. Consequently,
though outwardly most friendly, he was bitterly
opposed to the white Rajah, against whom he was already
plotting to accomplish his eviction, or his death. Though
Pangiran Usup was well aware of the Rajah's determination
to stamp out piracy and oppression, yet he was not wise
enough to foresee that to measure his strength against a
chivalrous and resolute Englishman, who had even a
stronger support behind him than those forces he was
already slowly and surely gathering around himself, must be
futile, and that it would end in his own ruin. Among the
Sultan's legitimate uncles the only man of ability and
integrity was the Pangiran Bedrudin, who had accompanied
the Rajah to Bruni, and who was always frank with him
and supported his schemes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah had daily interviews with the Sultan, who
expressed a great personal regard for him, and frequently
swore "eternal friendship," clasping his hand and repeating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>"<em><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">amigo</span> saya, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">amigo</span> saya</em>."<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c011'><sup>[105]</sup></a> He readily confirmed the
cession made by Rajah Muda Hasim, being satisfied with
the amount promised as his share of the Sarawak revenue,
and said, "I wish you to be there; I do not wish anybody
else; you are my <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">amigo</span></i>, and it is nobody's business but mine;
the country is mine, and if I please to give you all, I can."</p>

<p class='c000'>The deed to which Rajah Muda Hasim had affixed
his seal on September 24, 1841, was to the following
effect:—</p>

<p class='c013'>That the country and government of Sarawak is made over to
Mr. Brooke (to be held under the crown of Bruni), with all its
revenues and dependencies, on the yearly payment of
500. That
Mr. Brooke is not to infringe upon the customs or religion of the
people; and in return, that no person is to interfere with him in
the management of the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The confirmatory deed was executed on August 1,
1842, and was in tenor and purport similar to that granted
by Hasim, with the exception of an additional clause precluding
the alienation of Sarawak by the Rajah without the
consent of the Sultan.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sultan also told the Rajah that it would be a
delight to him to welcome both his uncles, Hasim and
Bedrudin, back to Bruni, and begged the Rajah to carry for
him a friendly letter to the former, conveying assurance
that he was completely reconciled to him. Bruni, he said,
would never be well until his return. The Lascars of the
<em>Lord Melbourne</em> were at once given up, and the Rajah also
procured the release of three of the <em>Sultana's</em> Lascars, who
had been transferred to Bruni masters. He remained at
Bruni for ten days—a period, as he wrote, "quite sufficient
to discover to me the nakedness of the land, their civil
dissensions, and the total decay of their power, internal and
external."</p>

<p class='c000'>On his return the Rajah received a cordial welcome,
for it was believed that he would certainly be killed in
Bruni; and on September 18, the deed was read appointing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>him to hold the government of Sarawak. The ceremony
was impressive, but it nearly became tragical. We will give
the Rajah's own description of it. After the deed had been
read—</p>

<p class='c013'>The Rajah (Muda Hasim) descended, and said aloud "If any
one present disowns or contests the Sultan's appointment, let him
now declare." All were silent. He next turned to the Patinggis
and asked them. They were obedient to the will of the Sultan.
Then came the other pangirans. "Is there any pangiran or any
young Rajah that contests the question? Pangiran der Makota,
what do you say?" Makota expressed his willingness to obey.
One or two other obnoxious pangirans, who had always opposed
themselves to me, were each in turn challenged, and forced to
promise obedience. The Rajah then waved his sword, and with a
loud voice exclaimed, "Whoever he is that disobeys the Sultan's
mandate now received I will separate his skull." At the moment
some ten of his brothers jumped from the verandah, and, drawing
their long krises, began to flourish and dance about, thrusting close
to Makota, striking the pillar above his head, and pointing their
weapons at his breast. This <em>amusement</em>, the violence of motion,
the freedom from restraint, this explosion of a long pent up
animosity, roused all their passions; and had Makota, through an
excess of fear or an excess of bravery, started up he would have
been slain, and other blood would have been spilt. But he was
quiet, with his face pale and subdued, and, as shortly as decency
would permit after the riot had subsided, took his leave.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah now ordered Makota to leave the country,
an order that could not be ignored, though he kept deferring
his departure on one pretext after another, and it was
not until the arrival of the <em>Dido</em> some eight months later
that he quitted Sarawak, and that suddenly. He then
joined Sherip Sahap at Sadong, and when that piratical
chief's power was broken, he retired along with him to
Patusan. Makota was captured after the destruction of that
place in 1844, but, unfortunately, the Rajah spared his
life. He then retired to Bruni, there to continue his plots
against the English, and in 1845 was commissioned by the
Sultan to murder Rajah Brooke, but found that the execution
of this design would be too distinctly dangerous; and,
though he bearded the lion in his den, it was only in the
guise of a beggar. At Bruni he rose to power, and, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>already related in chapter II., became a scourge to the natives
in that part of the sultanate. His end was this:—In
November, 1858, he headed a raid at Awang in the
Limbang to sweep together a number of Bisaya girls to
fill his harem, when he was fallen upon by the natives at
night time and killed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah now set to work in earnest to put the
Government on a sound footing. He made no attempt
to introduce a brand new constitution and laws, but took
what already existed. He found the legal code was just
enough on paper, but had been over-ridden and nullified
by the lawless pangirans. All that was necessary was to
enforce the existing laws, modifying the penalties where
too cruel and severe, and introducing fresh laws as
occasion required. "I hate," he wrote in October, "the
idea of an Utopian government, with laws cut and dried
ready for the natives, being introduced. Governments, like
clothes, will not suit everybody, and certainly a people who
gradually develop their government, though not a good one,
are nearer happiness and stability than a government of the
best which is fitted at random. I am going on slowly and
surely, basing everything on their own laws, consulting all
the headmen at every step, instilling what I think right—separating
the <em>abuses</em> from the customs." The government
which he had displaced was so utterly bad that any change
was certain to be accepted by the people with hope of
improvement; and when it was found, that by the introduction
of a wise system of taxation, which actually doubled
the revenue, whilst to the popular mind it seemed to halve
their burden—when, moreover, they found that justice was
strictly and impartially administered in the courts—they
welcomed the change with whole-hearted gratitude. The
Rajah associated the native chiefs with himself in the
government, and found them amenable to wholesome
principles, and on the whole to be level-headed men. By
this means mutual confidence was inspired, and the foundation
laid of a government, the principle of which was and
has ever since been "to rule for the people and with the
people," to quote the Rajah writing twenty-two years later,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>"and to teach them the rights of freemen under the restraints
of government. The majority of the "Council"<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c011'><sup>[106]</sup></a>
secures a legal ascendency for native ideas of what is best
for their happiness, here and hereafter. The wisdom of the
white man cannot become a <em>hindrance</em>, and the English
ruler must be their friend and guide, or nothing. The
citizen of Sarawak has every privilege enjoyed by the
citizen of England, and far more personal freedom than is
known in a thickly populated country. They are <em>not</em>
taught industry by being forced to work. They take a
part in the government under which they live; they are
consulted upon the taxes they pay; and, in short, they are
free men.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This is the government which has struck its roots into
the soil for the last quarter of a century, which has triumphed
over every danger and difficulty, and which has inspired its
people with confidence."</p>

<p class='c000'>The revenue of Sarawak was in utter confusion. Over
large tracts of country no tax could be enforced, and the
Rajah, as he had undertaken, was determined to lighten the
load that had weighed so crushingly, and was inflicted so
arbitrarily on the loyal Land-Dayaks—loyal hitherto, not in
heart, but because powerless to resist. To carry on the
government without funds was impossible, and the want of
these was now, and for many years to come, the Rajah's
greatest trouble. Consequently the antimony ore was made
a monopoly of the government, which was a fair and just
measure, and to the general advantage of the community,
though it was subsequently seized upon as a pretext for
accusing the Rajah of having debased his position by
engaging in trade. But it was years before the revenue
was sufficient to meet the expenditure, and gradually the
Rajah sacrificed his entire fortune to pay the expenses of
the administration.</p>

<p class='c000'>In undertaking the government he had three objects in
view:—</p>

<p class='c000'>(1) The relief of the unfortunate Land-Dayaks from
oppression.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>(2) The suppression of piracy, and the restoration to
a peaceable and orderly life, of those tribes of Dayaks
who had been converted into marauders by their Malay
masters.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) The suppression of head-hunting.</p>

<p class='c000'>But these ends could not be attained all at once. The
first was the easiest arrived at, and the news spread through
the length and breadth of the island that there was one
spot on its surface where the native was not ground to
powder, and where justice reigned. The result was that the
Land-Dayaks flocked to it. Whole families came over
from the Dutch Protectorate, where there was no protection;
and others who had fled to the mountains and the jungle
returned to the sites of their burnt villages.</p>

<p class='c000'>How this has worked, on the same undeviating lines of
a sound policy, under the rule of the two Rajahs, the
following may show. Writing in 1867, on revisiting
Sarawak, Admiral the Hon. Sir Henry Keppel said:</p>

<p class='c013'>It brought back to my mind some four-and-twenty years ago,
when I first came up in the <em>Dido</em> with Sir James Brooke on board,
and gave the first and nearly the only help he had in securing his
position, thereby enabling him to carry out his philanthropic views
for the benefit of a strange race. If he had not succeeded to the
full extent of his then sanguine hopes, still there is no man living,
or to come, who, single-handed, will have benefited his fellow-creatures
to the extent Brooke has. In 1842, piracy, slavery,
and head-hunting were the order of the day. The sail of a
peaceful trader was nowhere to be seen, not even a fisherman, but
along the length of this beautiful coast, far into the interior, the
Malays and Dayaks warred on one another. Now how different!
Huts and fishing stakes are to be seen all along the coast, the
town of Kuching, which on the visit of the <em>Dido</em>, had scarcely
800 inhabitants, now has a population of 20,000. The aborigines,
who called themselves warriors, are now peaceful traders and
cultivators of rice. The jungle is fast being cleared to make
way for farms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Head-hunting, the third aim which Rajah Brooke held
before his eyes, was an ingrained custom of the race which
could not be eradicated at once. The utmost that he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>effect at first was to prevent the taking of heads of any of
the subjects under his rule. All the tribes that were in his
raj were to be regarded as friends, and were therefore not to
be molested. Any breach of the peace, every murder was
severely punished. In a short time head-hunting and intertribal
feuds amongst the Sarawak Dayaks were extirpated,
and the raj ceased to be a hunting-field for the Sekrang and
Saribas Dayaks; but they continued to haunt the coast
together with the Lanun and Balenini pirates, and the
suppression of piracy was the most serious undertaking of
the three, and took many years to accomplish.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in 1843, the Rajah visited Singapore to further the
interests of his raj, and for a change. His main wish, which
he had repeatedly expressed, was to transfer Sarawak to the
Crown, and he likewise impressed upon the Government
the policy of establishing a settlement at Labuan, and of
obtaining a monopoly of the coal in the Bruni Sultanate.
He was able to interest the Chinese merchants in the trade of
Sarawak. But the most important matter was the immediate
suppression of the ravages committed by the pirates, both
Dayak and Malay; and here Providence threw across his
path, in the person of Captain the Hon. Henry Keppel,<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c011'><sup>[107]</sup></a> the
very assistance he required. Between the white Rajah and
the Rajah Laut (Sea King), the title by which Keppel became
known, and was ever afterwards remembered in Sarawak,
a sincere attachment arose. Keppel was attracted by the
Rajah's lovable personality, and sympathised with his objects;
and, being chivalrous and always ready to act upon his own
responsibility, he at once decided to lend all the support in
his power, which any other naval officer might have hesitated
to have done. The aid he so nobly rendered came at an
opportune time, for it not only administered to the pirates
a severe lesson, but also taught those inimical to his rule
that the white Rajah was not held aloof by his own countrymen,
and thus consolidated his power by reassuring the
waverers and encouraging the loyal. The kindly and
gallant Keppel stands foremost amongst the friends of
Sarawak, to which State he rendered not only the splendid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>services to be recorded in our next chapter, but ever evinced
a keen and kindly interest in its welfare, and in its Rajahs,
to whom he was ever ready to lend his able support and
influence, and of whom the Rajah wrote, "He is my friend
and the benefactor of Sarawak."</p>

heir-apparent. At this time Sultan Omar Ali had two sons, and the eldest, also
named Hasim, must have been about thirty-five years of age. There was a disgraceful
harem scandal in connection with their birth, which pointed to their having been the
sons of a Nakoda, or merchant. Though this appears to have been generally credited,
Hasim nevertheless became the 24th Sultan in 1885.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be noted here that Omar Ali himself was only <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i> Sultan, as he
was never able to obtain the legal investiture which in Bruni constitutes an election
to the throne <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de jure</span></i>, and which confers upon the sovereign the title of <em>Iang de
Pertuan</em>, the Lord who rules, the most exalted title, and one which he never assumed.</p>

As we have already mentioned, the
second, and by far the most difficult,
task that Rajah Brooke had
set before him, and was determined
to accomplish, was the
suppression of piracy, which he
rightly described as an evil almost
as disgraceful to the European
nations who permitted it as to
the native States engaged in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The principal piratical peoples
at the time were the Illanun,
or Lanun, the Balenini, the
Bajaus, and the Sulus, all living to the north or north-east of
Bruni, and consequently far beyond the jurisdiction of the
Rajah. To these must be added the Sea-Dayaks of the
Saribas and Sekrang, who, led by their Malay allies, though
less formidable to trade, were far more destructive of human
life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sambas Malays had also been pirates, but at this
period had ceased to be such. Earl, who visited Sambas
in 1834, says, that "before the arrival of the Dutch Sambas
was a nest of pirates. In 1812, having attacked an English
vessel, several British men-of-war were sent from Batavia to
attack the town. The inhabitants resisted, but were defeated,
the fort was razed to the ground, and the guns tumbled into
the river." The reoccupation by the Dutch shortly afterwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>of this place, Pontianak, and Banjermasin, put some
check upon the piratical habits of the Malays in the western
and southern States,<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c011'><sup>[108]</sup></a> but the Malays of the eastern shores
of Borneo, especially those of Koti, to the north and
north-west, were all pirates; and even the people of Bruni
were imbued with piratical habits, which were generally
inherent in the Malay character, though they were not enterprising
enough to be openly piratical, or to do more than
encourage their bolder neighbours, from whom they could
obtain plunder and slaves cheaply; and near Bruni, within
the territory of the Sultan, were several piratical strongholds.
All these were under the control of half-bred Arab sherips,
as also were the Saribas and the Sekrangs.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lanuns are natives of the large island of Mindanau,
or Magindanau, the southernmost of the Philippine group.
They were known to the Spaniards as "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Los Illanos de la
laguna</span>," and, in common with all Muhammadans, were classed
by them as Moros or Moors. On the lagoon, or bay, of Lanun
they live. They were the boldest and most courageous of the
pirates, and the most dangerous to Europeans, whom they
never hesitated to attack, not even the Dutch gunboats, and
to whom, unlike the Balenini pirates, they would never give
quarter, owing to a hatred, born of former injustice and
inhumanity, received at the hands of those whom they could
only have regarded as white barbarians. They became
incorrigible and cruel pirates, looking upon piracy as a
noble profession, though Dampier, who spent six months
amongst them in 1686-7, and who was very hospitably
treated, says nothing of piracy, and he gives a full and
intelligent account of the island, its inhabitants, and products.
He describes the "Hilanoons" as being a peaceable
people, who bought foreign commodities with the product
of their gold mines. The Spaniards had sometime before
occupied the island, but the garrison had to be suddenly
withdrawn to Manila, in consequence of a threatened invasion
of that place by the Chinese. The Sultan then seized their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>cannon, demolished their forts, and expelled their friars.
Then it was the Dutch they feared; they wished the English
to establish a Factory there,<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c011'><sup>[109]</sup></a> and subsequently, in 1775, ceded
a small island to the H.E.I. Company for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the Spanish had a settlement on the western
end of the island they were unable to keep the Lanun
pirates in check, and on occasions were severely handled
by them, as were also the Dutch.</p>

<p class='c000'>With these pirates were associated the Bajaus or sea-gipsies,
a roving people, who lived entirely in their prahus,
with their women and children.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vessels employed by Lanuns on marauding expeditions
were sometimes of 60 tons burden, built very sharp
in the prow and wide in beam, and over 90 feet in
length. A double tier of oars was worked by slaves to
the number of 100, and the fighting men would be
from 30 to 40; the prahus of the smallest size carried
from 50 to 80 in all. The bows of the vessels were
solidly built, and fortified with hard wooden baulks capable
of resisting a 6-pounder shot; often they were shod with
iron. Here a narrow embrasure admitted a gun for a 6 to
a 24-pound shot. In addition to this, the armaments consisted
of several guns, usually of brass, of smaller calibre.
Sometimes the piratical fleets comprised as many as 200
prahus, though the Lanuns usually cruised in small fleets of
20 to 30 sail. They would descend on a coast and attack
any village, sack and burn it, kill the defenders, carry away
men, women, and children as slaves, slaughter the cattle,
and ravage the plantations. A cargo of slaves captured
on the east coast of Borneo would be sold on the west
coast, and those taken in the south would find a ready
market in the north, in Sulu<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c011'><sup>[110]</sup></a> and the Lanun country.
Their cruising grounds were extensive—around the coasts
of the Philippine islands, Borneo, and Celebes to Sumatra,
Java, and the Malay peninsula, through the Moluccas to New
Guinea, and even up the Bay of Bengal as far as Rangoon.
In 1834, a fleet of these Lanuns swept round the coast of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>small island in the Straits of Rhio, opposite Singapore, and
killed or carried away all the inhabitants.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c011'><sup>[111]</sup></a> In addition to
their original home in the bay of Lanun, they had settlements
in Marudu Bay in the north of Borneo, and towns
along the west coast almost as far south as Ambong, and
on the east coast to Tungku, and on to Koti. In Marudu
their chief was Sherip Usman, who was married to a sister
of the Sultan Muda of Sulu, and who was in league with
Pangiran Usup, uncle to the Sultan of Bruni, and his
principal adviser. Usman supplied the pirates with powder,
shot, and guns, and they, on returning from a piratical
expedition, paid him at the rate of four captives for every
100 rupees worth of goods with which he had furnished
them. Such captives as had been taken in the vicinity of
Bruni he would sell to Pangiran Usup for 100 rupees each,
who would then demand of their friends and relations Rs. 200
for each. "Thus this vile Sherip, not reckoning the enormous
price he charged for his goods in the first instance, gained
500 per cent for every slave, and the Pangiran Usup cleared
100 per cent by the flesh of his own countrymen."</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1844, Ambong was a flourishing town occupied by
an industrious and peaceable people, subjects of the Sultan
of Bruni. In 1846, Captain Rodney Mundy, R.N., visited
it, and the town was represented by a heap of ruins alone;
the inhabitants had been slaughtered, or enslaved to be
passed on to Usup, that he might make what he could out
of them, by holding them to ransom by their relatives.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Balenini were hand in glove with the Lanuns, and
often associated with them in their expeditions. They
issued from a group of islands in the Sulu sea, and acted
in complicity with the Sultan of Sulu, whose country was
the great nucleus of piracy. They equipped annually considerable
fleets to prey upon the commerce with Singapore
and the Straits; they also attacked villages, and carried off
alike crews of vessels and villagers to slavery, to be crowded
for months in the bottom of the pirate vessels, suffering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>indescribable miseries. Their cruising grounds were also
very extensive; the whole circuit of Borneo was exposed
to their attacks, except only the Lanun settlements, for
hawks do not peck out hawk's een. When pursued and
liable to be overtaken, they cut the throats of their captives
and threw them overboard, men, women, and children alike.
Up to 1848, the principal Balenini strongholds were in
Balenini, Tongkil, and Basilan islands, but they were then
driven out of the two former islands by the Spaniards, and
they established themselves on other islands in the Sulu
Archipelago; and Tawi Tawi island, which had always been
one of their strongholds, then became their principal one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Trade with Borneo and the Sulu Archipelago was
rendered almost impossible, or at least a very dangerous
pursuit, and even merchantmen using the Palawan passage to
China, which takes them close along the coast of Borneo, often
fell a prey to these pirates.</p>

<p class='c000'>Earl, writing a year or two before the advent of the late
Rajah to Sarawak, remarks in connection with Borneo, that it
ought to be considered but "an act of justice to the natives
of the Indian Archipelago, whom we have enticed to visit
our settlement of Singapore, that some exertion should be
made towards the suppression of piracy." He blames the
unaccountable indifference and neglect which the British
Government had hitherto displayed, and expresses his
sympathy for the natives. He considered it his duty to
point the way—it was left to the late Rajah to lead in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Natuna, the Anamba, and the Tambilan islands,
which stretch across the entrance of the China sea between
Borneo and the Malay peninsula, were common lurking
haunts of the pirates. Amongst these islands they could
find water and shelter; could careen, clean, and repair their
prahus; and they were right in the track of vessels bound
to Singapore, or northward to the Philippines or China.
To replenish their stores and to obtain arms and ammunition
they would sail to Singapore in innocent-looking captured
prahus, where they found a ready market for their booty
amongst the Chinese. Muskets of English make and
powder from English factories were found in captured prahus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>and strongholds. At Patusan a number of barrels of fine
gunpowder from Dartford were discovered exactly as these
had left the factory in England.</p>

<p class='c000'>Against these the Rajah was powerless to take the offensive.
They had to be left to be reduced or cowed by the
spasmodic efforts of British men-of-war. What he urged,
though ineffectually, was that a man-of-war should patrol
the coast and curb the ruffians. What was actually done, but
not until later, was to attack and burn a stronghold or two,
and then retire. The pirates fled into the jungle, but returned
when the British were gone, rebuilt their houses, and supplied
themselves with fresh vessels.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near at hand were the Saribas and Sekrang Sea-Dayaks
occupying the basins of rivers of these names, the Sekrang
being an affluent of the Batang Lupar.</p>

<p class='c000'>In each of these rivers was a large Malay community
of some 1000 fighting men who lived by piracy, and who
trained the numerous Dayaks, by whom they were
surrounded, to the same lawless life that they led themselves,
and guided them on their predatory excursions.
Here again both Dayaks and Malays were under the
influence of Sherips, Mular, his brother Sahap, and others.
In course of time these Dayaks became expert seamen, and,
accompanied by the Malays, yearly issued forth with fleets
composed of a hundred or more bangkongs,<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c011'><sup>[112]</sup></a> sweeping the
seas and carrying desolation along the shores of Borneo over
a distance of 800 miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sea-Dayaks soon became aware of their power;
and accordingly, both in their internal government and on
their piratical expeditions, their chiefs attained an authority
superior to that of the Malay chiefs, their titular rulers.</p>

<p class='c000'>In May, 1843, H.M.S. <em>Dido</em> started on her eventful cruise
to Borneo, having the Rajah on board. After passing
Sambas, Captain Keppel dispatched the pinnace and two
cutters under the first lieutenant, with whom went the
Rajah, to cruise along the coast. Lanun pirates were seen,
but, easily outsailing the flotilla, escaped. Off Sirhasan,
the largest of the group of the Natuna islands, whither the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>boats had been directed to go, six prahus, some belonging to
the Rajah Muda of Rhio (an island close to Singapore,
belonging to the Dutch, and under a Dutch Resident), and
some to the islanders, mistaking the <em>Dido's</em> boats for those of
a shipwrecked vessel, and expecting an easy prey, advanced
with boldness and opened fire upon them. They were quickly
undeceived, and in a few minutes three out of the six prahus
were captured, with a loss of over twelve killed and many
wounded. Neither the Rhio Malays nor those of the islands
were pirates, and the former under an envoy were collecting
tribute for the Sultan of Lingin, but the temptation was irresistible
to a people with piracy innate in their character.
They protested it was a mistake, and that with the sun in
their eyes they had mistaken the boats for Lanun pirates!
The little English flotilla had suffered no casualties, and a
severe lesson had been administered, which was rightly
considered to be sufficient. The wounded were attended to,
and, having been liberally supplied with fresh provisions,
Lieutenant Wilmot Horton left for Sarawak to rejoin the
<em>Dido</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>After having been cleverly dodged by three Lanun
prahus, the <em>Dido</em> anchored off the Muaratebas entrance on May
13th, and proceeded up to Kuching on the 16th. Keppel
described the Rajah's reception by his people as one of undisguised
delight, mingled with gratitude and respect, on the
return of their newly elected ruler to his country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The temerity of the pirates had become so great that it
was deemed advisable to despatch the little Sarawak gunboat,
the <em>Jolly Bachelor</em>, under the charge of Lieutenant
Hunt, with a crew of eighteen marines and seamen, to
cruise in the vicinity of Cape Datu, and there to await the
arrival of a small yacht which was expected from Singapore
with the mails, and to escort her to Kuching. Two or three
days after they had left, at about 3 o'clock one morning,
writes Captain Keppel:—</p>

<p class='c013'>The moon being just about to rise, Lieutenant Hunt, happening
to awake, observed a savage brandishing a kris, and performing his
war-dance on the bit of deck in an ecstasy of delight, thinking in all
probability of the ease with which he had got possession of a fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>trading boat, and calculating the cargo of slaves he had to sell,
but little dreaming of the hornets' nest into which he had fallen.
Lieutenant Hunt's round face meeting the light of the rising moon,
without a turban surmounting it, was the first notice the pirate had
of his mistake. He immediately plunged overboard; and before
Lieutenant Hunt had sufficiently recovered his astonishment, to
know whether he was dreaming or not, or to rouse his crew up,
a discharge from three or four cannons within a few yards, and the
cutting through the rigging by the various missiles with which the
guns were loaded, soon convinced him there was no mistake. It
was as well the men were still lying down when this discharge took
place, as not one of them was hurt; but on jumping to their legs,
they found themselves closely pressed by two large war-prahus, one
on each bow. To return the fire, cut the cable, man the oars,
and back astern to gain room, was the work of a minute; but now
came the tug-of-war, it was a case of life and death. Our men
fought as British sailors ought to do; quarter was not expected on
either side; and the quick and deadly aim of the marines prevented
the pirates from reloading their guns. The strong bulwarks or
barricades, grapeshot proof, across the fore part of the Lanun
prahus, through which ports are formed for working the guns, had
to be cut away by round shot before the muskets could bear effectually.
This done the grape and cannister told with fearful execution.
In the meantime, the prahus had been pressing forward to board
while the <em>Jolly Bachelor</em> backed astern; but as soon as this service
was achieved, our men dropped their oars, and seizing their muskets
dashed on: the work was sharp but short, and the slaughter great.
While one pirate boat was sinking, and an effort made to secure
her, the other effected her escape by rounding the point of rocks
where a third and larger prahu, hitherto unseen, came to her assistance,
and putting fresh hands on board and taking her in tow,
succeeded in getting off, although chased by the <em>Jolly Bachelor</em>, after
setting fire to the crippled prize, which blew up and sank.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c011'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>None of the crew of this prahu survived, and so few in
the second prahu, that, when she separated from her consort,
the slaves arose and put them to death. They were the
same three prahus that had eluded the <em>Dido</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having satisfied himself as to the character of the Saribas
and Sekrang Dayaks, and how the chiefs governing them
encouraged their depredations, and having received an appeal
from the Rajah Muda Hasim<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c011'><sup>[114]</sup></a> to relieve the cost of the perils
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>it underwent, Captain Keppel resolved to attack the Saribas
first, as being the most formidable of the two piratical hordes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Preparations for the expedition were soon commenced.
It was to consist of a native force of 300 Malays, the <em>Dido's</em>
three large boats, and the <em>Jolly Bachelor</em>, manned by blue-jackets
and marines, all under the command of Lieutenant
Wilmot Horton. The datus were opposed to the Rajah
going—they thought the risk too great, but on his expressing
his determination to do so, and leaving it to them to
accompany him or not, their simple reply was, "What is the
use of our remaining? If you die, we die; and if you live,
we live; we will go with you."<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c011'><sup>[115]</sup></a> The Rajah and Captain
Keppel accompanied the expedition in the <em>Dido's</em> gig.</p>

<p class='c000'>Intelligence of the design was carried far and wide.
The Saribas strengthened their defences, and several of
the half-bred Arab sherips living nearer Sarawak sent in
promises of good conduct. Tribes that had suffered from
the depredations of the pirates offered to join in attacking
them, and the force thus augmented by several hundreds of
Dayaks started early in June.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first skirmish fell to the lot of Datu Patinggi Ali,
who, having been sent on ahead, met a force of seven prahus
at the mouth of the Saribas, which he attacked and drove
back, after capturing one. Padi, a stockaded town some
60 miles up the Saribas river, and the furthest up of the
piratical strongholds, reputed also to be the strongest and
most important, was the first attacked, and though defended
by two forts and two booms of forest trees stretched across
the river, and being crowded with Malay and Dayak
warriors, it was carried on the evening of June 11, and the
place committed to the flames. The next day some 800
Balau Dayaks,<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c011'><sup>[116]</sup></a> under Sherip Japar of Lingga, joined the
force, keen to make reprisals for past injuries.</p>

<p class='c000'>The enemy, reckoned at about 6000 Dayaks and 500
Malays, had retired up-river, and against them a small force
of about 40 blue-jackets and the same number of Malays,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>under the Rajah and Lieutenant Horton, started the next
day. During the night they were repeatedly attacked by
the pirates, who, under cover of the darkness, closed in on
their assailants, especially where some marines held a post
on a cleared height overlooking the river. The pirates lost
a good many men, and the next morning, seeing the force
again preparing to advance, sent in a flag of truce and sued
for mercy. The Rajah then met their chiefs and explained
to them that it was in consequence of their acts of piracy
that they were now punished; that they had been cautioned
two years previously to abstain from these marauding expeditions,
and that they had disregarded this monition; he
assured them that they would be unmolested if they abstained
from molesting others, but that if they continued to prey on
their neighbours and to interfere with trading vessels they
would receive further castigation.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was proposed to these people that the towns of Paku
and Rembas should be spared, if they would guarantee the
future good conduct of the inhabitants. They coolly replied
that those people deserved the same punishment, which had
better be administered, otherwise they would continue pirating,
and would lead the Padi people astray again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paku was taken on the 14th, and burnt; here no resistance
was met with. The next day the chiefs submitted.
On the 17th, Rembas was attacked and taken, the Balau
Dayaks, under Sherip Japar, having all the fighting to do.
This was the largest and strongest town, and much plunder
was secured. After receiving the submission of the Rembas
chiefs the expedition returned to Kuching, having, in seven
days, destroyed the strongholds of the most powerful and
dreaded pirates on the north-west coast of Borneo, who for
years had defied both Bruni and Sarawak. Such an impression
was produced, that the Sekrangs sent messages
promising to abstain from piracy, and offering, if they were
spared, to give up a hundred women and children captives;
and Sherips Mular and Sahap, fearing the punishment they
so richly deserved, sent professions of future good conduct.
These were not accepted, but the day of reckoning had to be
deferred, for Keppel had received orders to return to China.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>The Saribas had suffered, but not the redoubtable
Sekrangs, and the former not so severely but that in a
couple of years all their losses could be repaired, their
stockades be rebuilt, and fresh prahus constructed, and the
old story of blood and rapine continued with little intermission,
not only by them, but by the Lanuns and Sekrangs
as well.</p>

<p class='c000'>A year was to elapse before Keppel's return; and we
will now record in their sequence the few events of interest
that happened during this short period.</p>

<p class='c000'>About a month after the departure of the <em>Dido</em>, the
<em>Samarang</em>, Captain Sir Edward Belcher, arrived at Kuching.
Sir Edward had been sent, consequent on Rajah Brooke's
actions and recommendations, to inquire personally into
and report officially upon the affairs and capabilities of
north-west Borneo. As Sir Spenser St. John writes—<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c011'><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>This visit was as useless as such visits usually are. What can
the most acute naval officer understand of a country during a few
days' or weeks' visit? He can describe more or less accurately its
outward appearance; but to understand its internal politics is not
possible in the time. And yet on such comparatively valueless
reports the British Government relies in a majority of cases. Mr.
Brooke suffered more than any other pioneer of civilisation from
the system.</p>

<p class='c000'>On getting under way to proceed to Bruni the <em>Samarang</em>
grounded on a rocky ledge off the town, and Sir
Edward's brief visit was protracted by a fortnight. The
ship, which lay in an extremely critical position, was righted
and got off the rocks before the <em>Harlequin</em>, <em>Wanderer</em>, <em>Vixen</em>,
and <em>Diana</em> arrived to assist her. Accompanied by the
Rajah, Sir Edward proceeded to Bruni towards the end of
August, but the latter's visit was very short; he saw the
Sultan for two hours only, and then, as small-pox was raging
in Bruni, departed for Singapore.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c011'><sup>[118]</sup></a> The principal object
of the Rajah's visit was obtained, as he was enabled to bear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>away a deed granting Sarawak in perpetuity to him and to
the heirs of his appointment.</p>

<p class='c000'>In December the Rajah left for Singapore, and there
the next month he received the news of his mother's death.
To quote the Rajah, after the first shock, he resolved to
seek in activity a relief from the lowness of spirits which he
suffered. This led him to join an expedition to punish
certain pirates on the coast of Sumatra for injuries done to
British ships. The ships employed were the <em>Harlequin</em>,
Captain the Hon. G. Hastings; the <em>Wanderer</em>, Captain
Seymour, with whom the Rajah sailed, and the East India
Company's steamer, the <em>Diana</em>. At Achin<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c011'><sup>[119]</sup></a> they found the
once powerful Sultan unable to control or punish his own
subjects, and the ships then proceeded to Batu and Murdu,
the strongholds of the pirates. The former town was burnt
without offering much resistance, but the latter gave them a
tough fight of five hours before it was taken. The pirates
lost from fifty to seventy men killed and wounded, the
English two killed, and about a dozen wounded, amongst
whom was the Rajah, who was shot inside the right arm,
and had an eyebrow cut in two by a spear. This was on
February 12, 1844.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Singapore the Rajah purchased a new vessel, the
<em>Julia</em>, having sold the <em>Royalist</em>; the <em>Julia</em> was fitted as a
gunboat. Early in June he returned to Sarawak in the
<em>Harlequin</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>He found that during his absence, his old enemy, Sherip
Sahap, had built many war-boats, and had made great preparations
for offensive operations. Kuching was supposed to
be his object, and it had been put in a state of defence, but
on the Rajah's return Sahap deemed it advisable to retire to
the Batang Lupar, and taking with him a large force marked
his course with bloodshed and rapine. He then fortified
himself at Patusan, below the Sekrang, and the Dayaks
were sent out ravaging in every direction. Eight villages
were burnt in the Sadong, the Samarahan people were
attacked, and many women and children were captured.
A party even ventured into Sarawak, and cut off two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Singgi Dayaks on their farm, but they did not get off
scot free, for the Rajah, starting in the middle of the
night, intercepted their return and gave them a sharp
lesson.</p>

<p class='c000'>Patusan,<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c011'><sup>[120]</sup></a> the stronghold of Sherip Sahap, with whom
was Pangiran Makota, was on the left-hand bank of the
Batang Lupar, about fifteen miles below the Undup stream,
up which, about seven miles from the mouth, was the
stockaded town of Sahap's brother, Sherip Mular. Besides
numerous Malays, these sherips were supported by the
Sekrang Dayaks, then estimated to number some 10,000
fighting men, and these warriors, though they might not
recognise the power of the sherips over them in other
matters, were always ready to respond to a summons to
engage in a plundering raid.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Keppel had been long expected, but the <em>Dido</em>
had been detained in India, and when she arrived on July
30, with the welcome addition of the H.E.I.C.'s steamer
<em>Phlegethon</em>, preparations for the coming expedition against
the Batang Lupar were so well forward that it was enabled to
start almost immediately. On board the <em>Dido</em> was the
Rajah's favourite nephew, midshipman Charles Johnson, who
eight years later became the Tuan Muda of Sarawak, and
who ultimately succeeded his uncle as Rajah.</p>

<p class='c000'>The combined force of blue-jackets, Malays, and Dayaks,
headed by the <em>Phlegethon</em>, started from Kuching on August
5th, and on the 7th were off Patusan. This place was well
fortified, sixty-four brass besides many iron guns were taken
there,<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c011'><sup>[121]</sup></a> and its five forts were captured, with heavy loss to
the pirates. The attacking party lost only one man killed,
the captain of the main-top of the <em>Dido</em>, who was cut in two
by a cannon-shot whilst loading the bow-gun of the <em>Jolly
Bachelor</em>; close to him was the present Rajah, who
fortunately escaped unhurt.</p>

<p class='c000'>So confident had Sherip Sahap and Pangiran Makota
been in the impregnability of their strongholds that they
had not taken the usual precaution of sending their women,
children, and property of value, to a distant place of refuge.
On their flight the unfortunate children were placed in
different nooks and corners.</p>

<p>THE PRESENT RAJAH AS A MIDSHIPMAN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>After having completely destroyed the town of Patusan,
and Makota's town about a mile above, the expedition moved
on upon the 10th. The <em>Phlegethon</em> was taken up as far as
the Sekrang, a very bold proceeding considering the dangerous
nature of the river, and the force was divided into three
divisions, to ascend the Undup, the Sekrang, and the main-river;
but the pirates, chiefly Malays, offered such a stubborn
resistance in the Undup that these divisions had to be reunited
to make a simultaneous attack. The gallant Datu Patinggi
Ali here distinguished himself in a hand-to-hand fight with
the enemy; it was witnessed by the blue-jackets, who hailed
him with three hearty British cheers on his return. It took
the force the whole day to cut through the heavy log barriers
that had been placed across the river below Mular's town,
which the enemy deserted during the night, retiring to a
Dayak village some twenty-five miles farther up the river.
After an arduous journey of two days the landing-place of
the village was reached; here occurred a brush with the
pirates, who were pushed back, and old Datu Patinggi
nearly covered himself with glory by almost capturing
Sherip Mular, who saved himself by ignominiously jumping
into the river and swimming ashore. A little later,
Captain Keppel and Lieutenant Wade with some seven men
surprised a large force of pirates waiting behind a point;
these were so taken by surprise that they were easily routed,
but Lieutenant Wade rushing on in pursuit was struck by two
rifle-shots, and fell at his commander's feet mortally wounded.
The Dayak village was then attacked, and the enemy
scattered.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 15th, the <em>Phlegethon</em> was reached, and on the
17th, a force started up the Sekrang to administer a lesson
to the notorious Dayak pirates of that river, who had been
making their presence felt in an unpleasant manner, continuously
annoying the force at night time by hanging about
on the river banks and killing and wounding several of the
Malay and Dayak members of the force. The expedition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>consisted of seven of the <em>Dido's</em> and <em>Phlegethon's</em> boats, and
the <em>Jolly Bachelor</em>, with a division of a few light native boats
under Datu Patinggi Ali as a vanguard, and the rest of the
Sarawak contingent behind as a reserve. On the 19th, the
enemy made a determined stand, blocking the advance of
Patinggi Ali's division with a formidable array of war-boats,
and with thousands of men on each bank, who had selected
positions where they could effectively use their javelins
and blow-pipes. Instead of falling back upon the main
body, old Ali bravely dashed on, followed by his little contingent.
A desperate encounter against fearful odds ensued,
and before the ships' boats could come to his support the fine
old Malay chief<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c011'><sup>[122]</sup></a> had fallen along with a Mr. Steward,<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c011'><sup>[123]</sup></a> and
twenty-nine of his devoted followers, fifty-six more being
wounded. The gun and rocket fire of the boats soon turned
the tables, and the Dayaks retreated from their position
with considerable loss. The same day their town was
destroyed, and the expedition returned. At Patusan, which
was reached on the 22nd, Captain Sir Edward Belcher, with
the boats of the <em>Samarang</em>, joined them, but too late to
render any service. At Kuching there was barely time
to get the sick and wounded into comfortable quarters
before news arrived that Sherip Sahap had joined Sherip
Japar at Lingga, and was again collecting his followers.
With the addition of the <em>Samarang's</em> boats, the force
immediately started for Lingga; Sherip Sahap hastily
retired, and, though closely pursued, escaped over the border;
Sherip Japar was deposed from his governorship of Lingga;
and Pangiran Makota was captured and sent a prisoner on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>board the <em>Phlegethon</em>. The Rajah then held a meeting of all
the Malay chiefs of the surrounding country, and in an
eloquent speech impressed upon them the determination of
the British Government to suppress piracy; dwelt upon the
blessings arising from peace and trade, and concluded by
saying that the measures lately adopted against piracy were
taken for the protection of all the peaceful communities
along the coast. "So great was the attention bestowed
during the delivery of his speech that the dropping of a
pin might have been heard."<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c011'><sup>[124]</sup></a> On September 4th, the force
again reached Kuching.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sherip Sahap, after residing for a short time in the
Kapuas, in Dutch Borneo, died of a broken heart at
Pontianak. Sherip Mular, who also escaped over the
border, subsequently sued for forgiveness, but this was then
refused.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c011'><sup>[125]</sup></a> Sherip Japar, who the previous year had rendered
good service against the Saribas pirates, was removed to
Ensingai in the Sadong. Pangiran Makota, who so richly
deserved death, and who as a matter of policy alone, as well
as in the interests of humanity, should have been executed,
was spared by the Rajah, and allowed to retire to Bruni,
with what results we have already noted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early the next year the Saribas and Sekrang Dayaks
visited the Rajah at Kuching and formally tendered their
submission. The promises then made of future good
behaviour would probably have been observed, and those, of
which there was now a large party, in favour of peace have
been upheld, had the British Government afforded the Rajah
continuous support for a short time, even in the shape of a
small brig-of-war. "We must progress or retrograde" was
the Rajah's timely, though unheeded warning. But the
desired support was denied, and gradually the piratical
party again became dominant, and in less than two years
found themselves in a position once more to defy the
Rajah, and to spread terror along the coast. But with this,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>and their final, though tardy punishment, we shall deal
later.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah seeing how precarious his position was, had
offered the cession of Sarawak to the British Crown without
remuneration, though he had now laid out £10,000 upon
its development. He showed how by developing the trade
and the natural wealth of the land through British influence,
river after river might be opened up to commerce. He
entreated that steady and unremitting efforts should be
made for the suppression of piracy. But the Government
shrank from the extension of its Colonies, it was afraid of
being dragged into a second New Zealand scheme, and it
consented, reluctantly, to afford him help, and that but
inadequate, against the pirates.</p>

<p class='c013'>"It is easy," wrote the Rajah at the close of the previous year,
"for men to perform fine feats with the pen; it is easy for the rich
man to give yearly thousands in charity; it is easy to preach against
the slave trade, or to roar against piracy; it is easy to bustle about
London, and get up associations for all kinds of objects—all this
is easy, but it is not easy to stand alone—to be exiled—to lay out
a small fortune—to expend life and health and money—to risk life
itself, when the loss would be without glory and without gain....
I am enabled to dispense happiness and peace to many thousand
persons. I stand alone; I appeal for assistance and gain none; I
have struggled for four years bearing my life in my hand. I hold
a commanding position and influence over the natives; I feel it my
paramount duty to gain protection and some power. I state it in
so many plain words, and if, after all, I am left to my own resources
the fault of failure is not with me. This negotiation with Government
is nearly at an end, or if protracted, if I perceive any intention
of delay, or any coolness, I will myself break it off and trust to God
and my own wits.... If they act cordially they will either give me
a plain negative or some power to act, in order that I may carry
out my views. If they haggle and bargain any further I will none
of them, or if they bother me with their suspicions, or send any
more gentlemen for the purpose of espionage, I will assert the independence
I feel, and send them all to the devil."</p>

<p class='c000'>This, it must be remembered, was in a private letter.
His position was precarious. He, with less than half-a-dozen
Englishmen, had established himself as reigning prince
over Sarawak; its population consisted mainly of timid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Land-Dayaks, useless in warfare, and there were only a few
hundred Malays and Sea-Dayaks upon whom he could rely
to protect the little State against its powerful and actively
hostile neighbours. Even his own people were in a condition
of tension and hesitation, not knowing whether the arm of
England would be extended in his support, or be withdrawn,
leaving him to succumb under the krises of assassins.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is perhaps as well that the British Government did
leave the Rajah so much alone; that he was able to exercise
a free hand to carry out his own ideas, and that he was not
crossed or hampered by the changing policies of the different
Cabinets that came into power—some ready to extend the
limits of the Empire, others shrinking from responsibilities,
and seeking to contract the sphere of British influence within
the narrowest limits, but all timid and nervous of opposition
from the adverse party. The little State has thus had the
advantage of having been governed for just seventy years
<em>directly</em> by two of the ablest rulers of Orientals, having an
intimate knowledge of their subjects and their requirements,
and governing with their people, instead of having been subject
to the capricious and often stupid government of the
Colonial Office, and of ever-changing governors. Unfortunately
the late Rajah was subsequently "crossed and
hampered" from home, notably by the little England party
at whose head stood Mr. Gladstone, and the greatest evil was
done to Sarawak by his own countrymen supported by a
timorous Government. Happily, the English rajahs, the
second as well as the first, by their honesty of purpose and
their inflexibility of resolution gathered about them a host of
native adherents; these they inspired with self-respect, and
confidence in their rulers, and thus formed a mass of public
opinion that went far towards making their rule permanent, and
enabled it to withstand checks from within and from without.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dutch at this time had been making praiseworthy
efforts to check the Lanuns; they had destroyed several
piratical fleets, and were preparing on a large scale to drive
them off the seas; in this, however, they failed.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some time the Rajah was free from his troublesome
neighbours, and he devoted his time to the affairs of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>his little State, the population of which had just received
an addition of 5000 families of Malays from the disturbed
districts along the coast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not till Hasim and his train of obstructive and rapacious
hangers-on had departed from Sarawak could the benefits
of the Rajah's administration take complete effect. So long
as these men remained, with their traditions of misrule, and
their distorted ideas of the relation between the governor and
the governed, a thousand difficulties were interposed, thwarting
the Rajah's efforts, and these had to be circumvented or
overcome. The pangirans, great and small, great in their self-confidence,
proud of the mischief they had wrought, small and
mean in their selfish aims, viewed the introduction of reform
with ill-disguised hostility; and the Rajah Muda Hasim in
their midst formed a nucleus about whom disaffection and
intrigue must inevitably gather and grow to a head.
Only Bedrudin was heart and soul with the Rajah, so far as
his lights went. He was a man of intelligence and generous
spirit, who had taken the lesson to heart that by good
government, the encouragement of commerce and the peaceful
arts, the country would thrive and the revenue in consequence
largely increase, and that his brother pangirans were
blindly and stupidly killing the goose that laid golden eggs.
To him the Rajah was sincerely attached, and the attachment
was reciprocated. Personally, the Rajah was sorry
when Bedrudin had to return with his brothers to Bruni;
but the Sultan's recall was imperative, and it obviated
all risk of the prince being made, unwillingly, a gathering
point of faction. It was advisable, moreover, that there
should be near the Sultan's ear a man like Bedrudin, who
would give wise counsel; and Hasim, weak and vacillating
as he was, could show his nephew by his own experience
that advantage would accrue to him by adopting a policy
favourable to British enterprise, and by warning him that
disaster, though approaching with lagging feet, must overtake
him inevitably if he attempted to thwart it. Furthermore, the
Sultan had been loud in his professions of affection for his dear
absent uncles, and of his desire to have them about his person.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in October, H.M.S. <em>Samarang</em>, Captain Sir Edward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Belcher, and the H.E.I.C.'s steamer <em>Phlegethon</em>, arrived to
convey to Bruni, Rajah Muda Hasim, his brothers, and their
numerous families, retainers, slaves, and hangers-on. The
Rajah himself went up in the <em>Samarang</em>. On approaching
Bruni there were signs of hostility from four forts on Pulo
Cheremin, which Pangiran Usup had frightened the Sultan
into building, but the flag of Hasim reassured the Brunis.
The exiles were well received. The Sultan declared he
would listen to no other adviser than Hasim, and the people
were in favour of him. Though Pangiran Usup had gained
great influence over the Sultan he deemed it prudent to
dissemble, and declared himself ready implicitly to obey
Hasim, and as a proof of good faith at once dismantled
the new forts on Hasim ordering him to do so. The poorer
classes, who had heard of the peace and security enjoyed by
the inhabitants of Sarawak, openly expressed their desire that
the Rajah should remain and govern conjointly with Pangiran
Muda Hasim. Labuan island, which the Sultan now offered
the Rajah, was examined, and the Rajah considered it superior
to Kuching for a settlement, as being in a more central and
more commanding position.<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c011'><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In February, 1845, Captain Bethune of H.M.S. <em>Driver</em>,
anchored in the Sarawak river, and brought a despatch from
Lord Aberdeen appointing the Rajah confidential agent in
Borneo to her Majesty, an appointment made mainly upon
the Rajah's own suggestion that official recognition would go
far to help him. He at once proceeded to Bruni in the
<em>Driver</em>, bearing a letter from the Foreign Office to the Sultan
in reply to his letters requesting assistance to suppress
piracy; and Captain Bethune had been directed to select a
suitable locality on the N.W. coast for the formation of a
British settlement, whence the sea along the north and west
coasts might be watched, and where there was coal suitable
for a coaling station.</p>

<p class='c000'>The letter was received by the Sultan and his pangirans
with due honours, and the Rajah told them that he "was
deputed by her Majesty the Queen to express her feelings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>of goodwill, and to offer every assistance in repressing piracy
in these seas." The Sultan stared. Muda Hasim said,
"We are greatly indebted; it is good, very good."<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c011'><sup>[127]</sup></a> And the
Sultan had reason to stare. Pangiran Usup, who was also
present, was no doubt likewise too much taken aback to do
anything else, ready as he was with his tongue, for such a
proffer was as unexpected as it was unwelcome. Hitherto
they had imagined, and with some reason, that owing to its
slowness and inaction, the British Government was lukewarm
in its intentions to suppress piracy; that outward
professions would not be taken seriously, and were all that
was needed of them to cover their secret encouragement of
their piratical neighbours. The Sultan, however, was a
clever dissembler; he joined with Hasim in expressing a
hope that with the Rajah's assistance the government of
Bruni might be settled, piracy suppressed, and trade fostered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah then went to Singapore to meet the Admiral,
Sir Thomas Cochrane, and to endeavour to interest him in
Bornean affairs, to gain his assistance against the pirates, and
in support of the party in Bruni that was in favour of reform.
He was successful as the sequel will show, and in May
returned to Bruni in the <em>Phlegethon</em>. He then discovered to
his no little concern that the Princes Hasim and Bedrudin
were in such danger that their brothers begged to be allowed
to return to Sarawak. They were exposed to the intrigues
of Pangiran Usup, who had not only poisoned the mind of
the Sultan against his uncles of legitimate blood, but who was
also bitterly hostile to English interference with piracy, which
was the main source of his revenue. The imbecile Sultan,
vicious at heart, and himself a participator in the spoils of
piracy, was of too contracted a mind to be able to conceive
the advantages that could be obtained were his capital converted
from a nest of brigands and slaves into an emporium
of commerce; and he was totally indifferent to the welfare
of the greater portion of his subjects, who being pagans, were
created by Allah to be preyed upon by the true believers.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c011'><sup>[128]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>He was accordingly induced to listen to Usup, of whom he
was really frightened, and to mistrust Hasim and Bedrudin.
To add to Hasim's troubles, the pirate chief of Marudu,
Sherip Usman, had sent a defiant message threatening to
attack him for favouring the English. If unsupported, the
Rajah foresaw that Hasim would be dragged into a civil war
which might end in his downfall. His life was in peril owing
to his leaning towards the British Government, and the Rajah
was determined to uphold him; if necessary, by bringing a
force from Sarawak to carry Bruni. If too late to save
him and Bedrudin, he resolved to burn Bruni from end to
end, and take care it should remain afterwards in desolation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah again proceeded to Singapore, and sufficiently
interested the Admiral in Bruni affairs to induce him to call
at that place with his squadron on his way to China. A
fresh outrage by Sherip Usman in plundering and burning a
brig decided the Admiral to take measures against him, and
by his detention in slavery of two British subjects Pangiran
Usup himself gave sufficient cause to call for punishment;
these captives he had placed in confinement whenever a man-of-war
appeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>On August 9, Sir Thomas Cochrane had an interview
with the Sultan, and the following morning called upon him
for the restoration of the captives held by Usup, and for
his punishment. The Sultan replied that Usup refused
obedience to him, and that he was powerless to enforce
it, and, as the offence was committed against the British,
he requested the Admiral himself to take Usup in hand.
Though the Admiral had brought a line-of-battle ship, two
frigates, two brigs, and three steamers, Usup, "strong in the
idea of his strength," was foolhardy enough to defy him, and
prepare for resistance. A shot was fired over his house from
the <em>Vixen</em>, which was replied to by the guns of his fortified
house, thereupon the steamer poured in a broadside and
knocked the house to shivers. Usup fled with the few
retainers he had with him—he had taken the precaution to
send away his women and treasure the day before. We
will return to him shortly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fleet then sailed to call Sherip Usman to account.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>His stronghold in Marudu Bay was attacked by a force of
550 men in twenty-four boats, and after a stout resistance
was taken with a loss of some twenty killed and wounded.
Amongst the former was Lieutenant Gibbard, and near
him, when he fell, was the present Rajah, then a midshipman
on the <em>Wolverine</em>. The pirates suffered heavily. Many
sherips and chiefs were killed, and Sherip Usman was himself
mortally wounded—he was carried away to die in the
jungle. As in the Batang Lupar the year previously, several
proofs of piracies committed upon European vessels here
came to light in the shape of articles taken from ships; and
such articles would probably have been more numerous had
there not been a market in Singapore for the more valuable
commodities.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah now returned to Sarawak in the <em>Cruiser</em>,
visiting Bruni on his way. Here he learnt that two days
after he had left the town, Pangiran Usup, full of rage and
resentment, had gathered a force to attack Bruni and take
and kill Pangiran Muda Hasim, and his brother Pangiran
Bedrudin, but the latter met him, inflicted on him a signal
defeat, and Usup was constrained to fly to Kimanis, some
seventy-five miles to the north-east of the capital, over which
district he was feudary lord. Then the two uncles insisted
upon their nephew the Sultan issuing a decree for his
execution. This was done, and the order transmitted to the
headman at Kimanis. It was carried out by him with
characteristic perfidy. Pretending to entertain a lively
friendship for the refugee, he seized an opportunity, when
Usup had laid aside his weapons in order to bathe, to fall
upon him and strangle him. His brother, Pangiran Yakub,
was executed at the same time.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the close of 1845, Sarawak was at peace within and
without. Trade was flourishing, and by immigration the
population had increased fourfold, and what had been but
a few years before a most miserably oppressed country was
now the happiest and most prosperous in Borneo.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah felt more secure, but he still wished for a
man-of-war to guard the coast, and, above all, for British
protection, and a flag with the Union cantoned in it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>In October, Sherip Mular, with Sherip Ahmit,<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c011'><sup>[129]</sup></a> was again
amongst the Sekrang Dayaks, and had induced them to go
on a piratical expedition with Sherips Amal, Long, and their
father Sherip Abu Bakar, but this rising the Rajah was
easily able to suppress with his own Malays aided by the
Balau Dayaks. The marauders were met and defeated by
the Balaus, who captured their eighteen boats, arms and
ammunition, and slew the Sekrang Dayak chief, Apai
Beragai, but the three sherips unfortunately escaped into the
jungle, and fled to Saribas. Timely warning of Sherip
Mular's conduct had been sent the Rajah by the well-disposed
Malay and Dayak chiefs of the Sekrang, of whom
there were now many. But the sherips returned, and again
gaining confidence and ascendency over the well disposed, in
February, 1846, the Sekrang Dayaks once more burst out,
and with a force of some 1200 men laid waste the coast,
burning villages, killing men, and carrying women and
children into slavery. They had fortified themselves up the
Sekrang, and felt themselves to be in a position to repel the
attack of any force that might be sent against them.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Sadong, on the Rajah's recommendation, a Malay
chief named Abang Kasim had been appointed governor by
the Bruni Government in succession to Sherip Sahap, with
the title of Datu Bandar;<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c011'><sup>[130]</sup></a> he was a man weak in character,
but with brains enough to be mischievous and get himself
into trouble; and the Land-Dayaks there were again being
so oppressed by the Malays that the Rajah found it
necessary to warn the latter that they would be punished
and turned out of the river if they did not desist.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sea-Dayaks of the Kanowit river, a large affluent
of the Rejang running towards the head of the Sekrang, by
reason of their raids on the Melanaus of Muka, Oya, Matu,
and the Rejang delta, now came under the Rajah's notice.
The Datu Patinggi Abdul Rahman,<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c011'><sup>[131]</sup></a> who was the nominal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Bruni governor of this large river, had sent letters to the
Rajah stating his desire to put down piracy; these were
accepted as an expression of good faith, though he was
suspected of conniving in these raids, and the Rajah
promised him assistance. The Kanowit Dayaks were from
the Sekrang, and were joined in their expeditions by the
Saribas and Sekrang Dayaks, who marched overland to join
them, so as to obtain a safer outlet to the sea than was now
afforded by the mouths of their own rivers. They had
lately destroyed Palo, in the delta, killed the men, and
had carried the women and children into captivity.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the death of Pangiran Usup it might have been
supposed that the Sultan, feeble and irresolute, would have
fallen under the influence of his uncles, Hasim and Bedrudin,
and would have been led to favour the English alliance, but
this was not so. He was angry at the rout of the pirates
of Marudu, and sore at being constrained to sign the death
warrant of Usup, his favourite and adviser; as also at the
shrinkage of the profits derived from the pirates, though at
the expense of the lives and persons of his own subjects.
He bore towards Hasim and Bedrudin that dislike which a
narrow and dull mind feels towards those who are morally
and intellectually his superiors, and such as a reigning prince
not infrequently entertains towards the man who will succeed
him on his throne. Accordingly he surrounded himself with
a number of scoundrels, led by one Haji Seman, a man of
low birth, the successor of Pangiran Usup as the Sultan's
chief adviser, who fawned on and flattered him, and to
whom he could pour forth his grievances; and these men,
many of them pangirans and chiefs, fanned his animosities,
and encouraged him in his evil courses, for they were still
favourable to the piratical party, and were desirous of
avenging the death of Pangiran Usup and the destruction
of Marudu. The princes, especially Hasim, who had recently
been publicly declared successor to the throne by the
Sultan, with the title of Sultan Muda, and Bedrudin, were
well aware that they were regarded with disfavour, and that
there was a powerful party against them; they knew they
were in danger, though they did not suspect that the danger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>was so imminent, and had applied for protection or release
from their engagements, but, to quote the Rajah, "they were
not protected, they were not released, except by a bloody
death in their endeavour to carry them out." The Sultan
detested them as favouring the English Rajah, and inclined
to a pro-British policy, and he resented having these men
so near the throne, and that the succession should devolve
on Hasim to the prejudice of his own reputed son, so he
resolved to sweep them from his path, and to break his
engagements with and to defy the English. As a further
incentive his avariciousness was played upon, and it was
pointed out to him how much he would gain by acquiring
the riches of his uncles were he to put them to death.
Swayed by his own atrocious motives, this wretched imbecile,
"brutal in spite of his imbecility," who had "the head of an
idiot and the heart of a pirate," readily yielded to the
promptings of his perfidious counsellors, and issued orders
for the despatch of all his uncles. So secretly were preparations
made to carry out the execution of this mandate
that the doomed princes were taken completely by surprise
by the well-armed bands that silently and simultaneously
surrounded their houses in the darkness of the night. With
most of the brothers resistance was impossible, and they
were soon butchered, but Bedrudin fought heroically. He
could, however, do little against the large body of murderers
opposed to him, with only a few followers to assist him.
These latter were soon cut down or had fled. His sister
and a favourite concubine remained, and fought by his
side, as well as a faithful slave, a lad named Japar.
Desperately wounded, having had his left wrist broken by a
shot, his shoulder and chest cut open so as to disable his
right arm, and his head and face slashed, but not before he
had cut down several of his assassins, Bedrudin, with the
women and the lad, who had also all been wounded, retired
into the house and barred the door. He bade the lad bring
him a keg of powder, break in the head, and strew some of
the contents about himself and his female companions; then
he drew off his signet ring, and ordered Japar to escape
and bear it to his friend the Rajah, with the message that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>he should tell the Queen of England of his fate, that he
had been true to his engagements, and begging his
friend, with whom his last thoughts were, never to forget
him. Japar slipped through an aperture in the floor,
dropped into the water, and swam to a canoe, in which he
escaped. Then, whilst the murderers, awed by his courage
and desperation, were hesitating to break into the house, the
true-hearted prince applied the match which blew himself
and his two noble companions into eternity.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c011'><sup>[132]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Sultan Muda Hasim, though wounded, managed to
escape from his burning house to the opposite side of the
river with several of his brothers, his wife and children, but
he was pursued and surrounded by numbers. Most of his
brothers had been killed, and others wounded, and no hope
remained to him but to throw himself on the mercy of his
nephew, the Sultan. He sent messages to him to beg that
his life might be spared, but this was peremptorily refused.
Death being inevitable, he retreated to a boat that chanced
to be moored to the bank, and placing a cask of gunpowder
in the cabin called upon his three brothers and his sons who
were with him to enter, and immediately firing the train,
the whole party was blown up. Hasim, however, was not
killed by the explosion, but, determined not to be taken
alive, he put a pistol to his head and blew out his brains.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the many uncles of the Sultan but four escaped, and
many of their relations, as well as other chiefs, were sacrificed.
Hasim's full brother, Muhammad, was desperately wounded,
and so cowed as to have his spirit broken. He was spared
as being harmless. Another brother went permanently mad
with terror. Thus the royal family had been nearly exterminated,
and the omen of the death of Rajah Api fulfilled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Japar escaped on board H.M.S. <em>Hazard</em>, which had
arrived and anchored below Bruni some three months after
the tragedy, and was taken in her to Kuching. He was
instrumental in saving the life of Commander Egerton by
warning him not to land, as a plot had been formed to take
his life.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>When news of this crime, which took place at the end of
December or the beginning of January, 1846, reached the
Rajah he was deeply moved. Of Bedrudin, whose loss he
considered irreparable, he wrote:—</p>

<p class='c013'>A nobler, a braver, a more upright prince could not exist. I
have lost a friend—he is gone and I remain; I trust, but in vain,
to be an instrument to bring punishment on the perpetrators of the
atrocious deed.... My suzerain the Sultan!—the villain Sultan!—need
expect no mercy from me, but justice he shall have. I no
longer own his authority, or hold Sarawak under his gift ... he
has <em>murdered our friends</em>, the faithful <em>friends</em> of Her Majesty's
Government, <em>because they were our friends</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah trusted the British Government would take
action against the Sultan, but if not, remembering he "was
still at war with this murderer and traitor," he would make
"one more determined struggle" to punish him and to
rescue the survivors of the Sultan Muda's family, and if that
failed, then Borneo<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c011'><sup>[133]</sup></a> and all for which he had so long, so
earnestly laboured, he considered must be abandoned. But
help was drawing near, for Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas
Cochrane on hearing of these troubles hastened from India
with his squadron to support the Rajah,<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c011'><sup>[134]</sup></a> and to bring the
Sultan to account. The fleet arrived off Sarawak at the end
of June, and, picking up the Rajah, the Admiral at once proceeded
to Bruni, visiting Serikei and Kanowit up the Rejang
on the way, to administer a warning to the people there.
The Sultan, frightened at what he had done, and expecting
reprisals, which, however, he was determined to oppose by
force, strengthened the existing defences, threw up new ones,
and called together 5000 men for the defence of the
capital. He proclaimed that he was determined to have
no more dealings with the English, and that he purposed to
drive the English Rajah from Sarawak.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the arrival of the fleet at the mouth of the Bruni
river the Sultan made a clumsy attempt, similar to that he
had made on Commander Egerton, to get the Admiral into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>his power. He sent two men, who represented themselves
to be pangirans, in a gaily decked prahu to welcome the
Admiral, with a letter to the Rajah, expressing hurt
surprise at the conduct of Commander Egerton in not
having visited him and in having refused his presents, and
begging the Rajah to put no faith in Japar's tales. The
messengers said that the Sultan would not permit the
Admiral to take up more than two boats with him; but
these men were detected by the Rajah to be men of no
rank, so they were detained on board, and their prahu was
secured astern.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 8th, having transferred his flag to the steam
frigate <em>Spiteful</em>, the Admiral proceeded up to Bruni with the
<em>Phlegethon</em> leading the way, and the <em>Royalist</em> which was
towed by the <em>Spiteful</em>. The gunboats of the ships left
behind also attended, and the total number of blue-jackets
and marines was 600; yet the Brunis, trusting to their
superiority in numbers, and to the really efficient steps they
had taken to fortify the town and its approaches, felt confident
that they could successfully oppose this formidable
force, and opened fire on the <em>Phlegethon</em> as she approached
the lower batteries. Fortunately the guns were aimed too
high to do damage. The fire was at once returned,—guns,
rockets, and muskets responding; the blue-jackets and
marines dashed ashore, and the enemy, commanded by
Haji Seman, not awaiting their onslaught, fled into the
jungle, abandoning the guns. The squadron then advanced,
silenced battery after battery, seven or eight in number,
and captured the cannon in them, consisting of 68, 42,
and 32 pounders, which, had they been well laid and
served, would have seriously crippled the ships; and the
forts were so strongly constructed and so well placed, that
they would have been difficult to capture had they been
manned by a less despicable foe. As it was, the loss incurred
on both sides was but slight.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sultan, his army, and the population fled, and as
night fell, Bruni was an empty shell. A week was spent by
Captain Mundy of the <em>Iris</em>, with whom went the Rajah, in a
fruitless endeavour to capture the Sultan, but he scampered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>away beyond reach, and the force, after destroying his inland
stronghold, returned to the ships.</p>

<p class='c000'>The people soon began to return, and a provisional
government was formed by the Rajah with Pangiran
Mumin, who afterwards became Sultan, and Pangiran
Muhammad at its head, and a message was despatched to the
Sultan with assurances of safe-conduct, if he would return to
Bruni, govern wisely and justly, and observe his engagements
with the English to do all in his power to keep the
piratical party in check. Sir Thomas Cochrane regretted
that he had not the authority, as he had the power, to place
the Rajah on the throne, a measure which he was convinced
would have been hailed with acclamation by the whole
people. After having completely destroyed all the batteries,<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c011'><sup>[135]</sup></a>
the Admiral sailed on July 20 to look up the piratical
villages to the north-east of Bruni, taking the Rajah, and
leaving the <em>Hazard</em> as a guard-ship at Bruni. Off Tempasuk
a Lanun prahu was captured, having two Spanish captives on
board, who had been taken off Manila; the crew of this
prahu were sent in irons to Manila to be dealt with by the
Spanish authorities—we may presume they never returned.
Tempasuk was burnt on August the 1st, and Pandasan the
next day. Both the <em>Royalist</em> and the <em>Ringdove</em> had brushes
with pirate vessels, the former destroying two with their
crews, and the latter one, but with the loss of her master
and a marine.</p>

<p class='c000'>After visiting the late Sherip Usman's town in Merudu,
which it was found had not been occupied since its destruction
just a year previously, the Admiral passed on to China,
leaving Captain Mundy, whom the Rajah now joined on the
<em>Iris</em>, to take any further operations against the pirates that
might be found necessary. One pirate prahu was met with
and destroyed, also another small Lanun stronghold near
Pandasan. At Kimanis information was received that Haji
Seman, after he had fled from Bruni, had fortified himself
at Membakut, near the Kimanis river; he was attacked and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>driven into the interior. The Lanuns shortly afterwards
abandoned the north-west coast, and established themselves
at Tungku on the east coast, where they were long left
unmolested.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the return of the Rajah to Bruni in the <em>Phlegethon</em>
on August 19, he found the Sultan still absent, so sent him
a message that if he returned he would be answerable for his
safety, and in reply the Sultan sent a humble letter laying
his throne and kingdom at the Rajah's feet. He at once
returned and sued for pardon. The Rajah would not see
him until the murderers of his uncles had been brought to
justice, and until he had given convincing proof of his
intention to govern his country uprightly, with the assistance
of advisers worthy of trust; pardon he must ask of the
Queen, upon whose flag he had fired, and the agreements
he had previously made must be re-ratified. All this the
Sultan engaged to do. In addition, he paid royal honours at
the graves of his murdered relatives; and, taking the most
humble tone and position, gave Sarawak to the Rajah unconditionally,
and granted him the right of working coal.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c011'><sup>[136]</sup></a>
But even then the Rajah refused to see him.</p>

<p class='c000'>To conclude the story of Sultan Omar Ali, he gave
little more trouble after the severe lesson he had been
taught, became afflicted with cancer in the mouth, and died
in 1852, when Pangiran Mumin succeeded to the throne.
He was a brother-in-law to the murdered princes, but only
remotely connected with the royal family, being descended
from Muhammad Ali the twelfth Sultan of Bruni, in or
about 1660, brother of the Sultan Abdul Jalil ul Akbar,
the ancestor of Omar Ali, who was seventh in descent from
him. The feeble-minded Abdul Mumin died at a great
age in 1885, when he was succeeded by Hasim Jalil ul
Alam Akmadin, the reputed son of Omar Ali; he died in
1906, over 100 years of age, and was succeeded by his
son, the present Sultan, Muhammad Jamal ul Alam.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah returned to Kuching at the end of August
in the <em>Phlegethon</em>, with "a perfect menagerie of old women
and children," the unhappy survivors of the Sultan Muda's
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>family.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c011'><sup>[137]</sup></a> Many other families had already fled from Bruni
to seek a refuge in the universal haven, Sarawak.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the deed which the Rajah now bore back with him,
the one under which Sarawak Proper is still held, the
sovereignty of James Brooke and his heirs in perpetuity
over the raj was acknowledged absolutely, and by it the
Sultan surrendered his claim to suzerainty. No yearly
payment was to be made for the province,<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c011'><sup>[138]</sup></a> and it was left
to the Rajah to dispose of as he pleased; hence he was
at liberty to hand it over to a foreign government if he
so wished.<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c011'><sup>[139]</sup></a> Sarawak now became <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de jure</span></i> independent; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de
facto</span></i>, it had been independent for some years; and the
Rajah "held a double claim to its possession—the will of
a free people strengthened by the cession made by a
sovereign, who was unable to rule his subjects."<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c011'><sup>[140]</sup></a> Such
being the position of the Sultan, the Rajah maintained
the title <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de jure</span></i> to be of small value, whilst the title derived
from the election and support of a free people he considered
of superior importance. The power of Bruni had become
but a shadow, not only in Sarawak but along the coast as
far as Oya, and the prerogative of the Sultan to grant
their country to any one was disavowed by the people of
Sarawak. Their ancestors had been free, and they had but
a few years previously voluntarily placed themselves under
the Bruni Government, upon certain conditions, but in the
decay of the Government of Bruni these had been disregarded,
and misrule succeeded. They rebelled and
successfully maintained an independent position; they had
offered their country to Holland; and had finally surrendered
to Mr. Brooke, conditionally upon his becoming their
ruler. All possession of territory in Borneo was a question
of might, and the Sultan himself looked to the Rajah
"to support his throne, and to preserve his government."<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c011'><sup>[141]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Though the question of the independence of Sarawak<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c011'><sup>[142]</sup></a> has
been placed beyond doubt by its recognition by the British
Government in 1863 as an absolutely independent State,
yet it has been maintained, and by some who should know
better, that the country is still under the suzerainty of Bruni.</p>

<p class='c000'>To conclude the eventful year of 1846, Captain Mundy
returned to Sarawak in December with instructions from the
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Lord Palmerston, conveyed
through Sir Thomas Cochrane, to occupy the Island of
Labuan, after consulting with the Rajah as to the best
mode of carrying out his instructions.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c011'><sup>[143]</sup></a> He at once proceeded
to Bruni, the Rajah going to Singapore. Labuan
was ceded on the 18th, and the British flag was hoisted on
the island on December 24.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dutch Government had viewed the Rajah's elevation
and settlement at Sarawak, as well as the past and recent operations
of the British on the north-west coast, with unfeigned
jealousy, and had, during the last two years, repeatedly
remonstrated with the British Government for countenancing
these proceedings, which the Dutch Minister, by a stretch
of imagination, exaggerated into having been the cause of
a general uneasiness arising in Holland "as to the security
and integrity of the Netherlands possessions in the Eastern
Archipelago," and a suspicion of "the Government having
surrendered, or very nearly so, the Eastern Archipelago to
England." Further, "the King's Government," extravagantly
wrote the Minister, "cannot forget how much it has had to
suffer at different epochs in India from the practices of this
individual (the Rajah), whom the Netherlands authorities
have everywhere found in their way, and constantly in
opposition to them." In his position as H.M.'s Political
Agent, "combined with his long experience and intimate
knowledge of Borneo," with "his desire to annoy, and his
ill-will towards the Netherlands," the Minister considered
him a very inconvenient and harassing personage to the
Netherlanders and their Government. The Netherlands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Government alleged that the Rajah's action in Sarawak
and the occupation of Labuan were an abandonment of
the spirit of the Treaty of 1824, if not of the letter. But
by that Treaty the Dutch sphere of influence in Borneo had
been limited to the equator, north of the line remaining within
the sphere of British influence. As the Minister foresaw,
Lord Aberdeen, on these grounds, denied that the recent
measures taken in Borneo were in any way a contravention
of the treaty or inimical to Dutch interests. Lord Aberdeen,
in supporting the Rajah, eulogised him as a gentleman of
high character, whose "efforts have been directed to the
furtherance of civilization, to the discouragement of piratical
pursuits, and to the promotion of the welfare of the native
population," and contended that he had obtained his
possessions "in the most legitimate manner." He further
implied that the Rajah's legitimate objects and pursuits
having met with undue interference by the Netherlands
authorities, occasion had perhaps been given for disputes
arising between him and the Netherlands Government, for
he was naturally "not favorably disposed to the extension
of Dutch influence in the parts where he had acquired
possessions";<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c011'><sup>[144]</sup></a> an influence which the Governor-General of
Netherlands India in his rescript of January 1846, mentioned
in footnote, p. <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>, said his Government did not
exercise in the State of the Sultan of Bruni, which extended
from cape Datu to the Kimanis river.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah wrote:—</p>

<p class='c013'>The Netherlands Government has made an attack upon me, but
it has failed. I am astonished at the misrepresentations to which it
stoops.... I never had any dispute with the Dutch authorities;
and the only communications which have passed between the
Resident of Sambas and myself have been of a most friendly kind.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c011'><sup>[145]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>But though she failed, it was some years before Holland
gave up her pretensions to Sarawak, pretensions which
twice before they could have realised—in 1833, when
Pangiran Usup offered her the country, and, a few years
later, when the Sarawak people asked for her protection;
but the one involved a monetary equivalent, and the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>military support, and she thought to acquire the country by
cheaper methods, which the Rajah knew she still meant to
do after his death if she could. Without his influence, and
without his influential friends, he did not think that Sarawak
could subsist after he was gone, and this it was that made
him so urgent to be put under British protection. When,
finally, the British Government did recognise Sarawak as
an independent State, the Netherlands Minister was asked
if he were aware of the recognition. The reply was,
"Holland will not recognise Sarawak, as the Government
is convinced that Sarawak cannot last beyond the lifetime
of Sir James Brooke." He added, "I told you this seven
years ago, and I see no reason, from recent events, to alter
my opinion."<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c011'><sup>[146]</sup></a> This was in 1863.</p>

<p class='c000'>The early part of 1847 was spent by the Rajah recruiting
his health on Penang hill, where a letter was received
from the Sultan notifying that Haji Seman had given himself
up at Bruni, and asking for instructions of the Admiral
and the Rajah as to his disposal. It was not considered
that his execution was now necessary as an example, and
the Sultan was informed that the past could be buried in
oblivion, but that misconduct in the future would revive its
recollection.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c011'><sup>[147]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In Singapore the Rajah received instructions from the
Foreign Office to proceed to Bruni to conclude a treaty
with the Sultan for the arrangement of commercial relations,
and for the mutual suppression of piracy; to reserve to
H.M.'s Government power and jurisdiction over all British
subjects residing within the Sultanate, and to bind the
Sultan not to alienate any portion of his dominions to any
foreign power or to others without the sanction of her
Majesty's Government. The Rajah proceeded to Bruni in
the <em>Nemesis</em>, touching at Kuching on his way, and the
treaty was signed on May 27. On the 30th, when leaving
the Bruni river, the <em>Nemesis</em> was hailed by a passing canoe,
and received the information that a fleet of pirates was in
the offing. The steamer immediately started in pursuit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>and the pirates, finding escape impossible, came to anchor
in a small bay with their bows seaward, and secured their
prahus, eleven in all, together with hawsers. The engagement
which followed, and which lasted several hours, the
pirates fighting desperately, resulted in five of the pirate
prahus being destroyed, and six effecting their escape.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c011'><sup>[148]</sup></a>
The <em>Nemesis</em> lost two killed and six wounded, and the
pirates about sixty killed. Fifty more, who had escaped
inland, were captured by the Sultan's men, and executed
in Bruni. About 100 captives, mostly Chinese and Malays,
were rescued and sent to Singapore. The pirates, who
were Baleninis, were on their return from a year's cruise
laden with plunder and captives. They had proposed to
attack Kuching, but had thought better of it.<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c011'><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The desire to visit England was now strong upon the
Rajah. Besides personal reasons, the wish to see his
relations and friends, and to obtain change and rest, he
also felt that he could effect more than by correspondence
were he personally to interest Ministers in Bornean affairs
and urge on them the necessity of a decided course for
the suppression of piracy, which could be put down were a
steady course pursued instead of mere convulsive efforts,
and Sulu he wished to see crushed.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c011'><sup>[150]</sup></a> Sarawak, where all
was peaceful, would be safe under the administration of
his connection, Mr. A. C. Crookshank.<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c011'><sup>[151]</sup></a> Labuan was
established as a naval station under naval administration.
Bruni had been reduced to subjection, and was powerless
to give further trouble, and the coast was generally quiet;
so, there being nothing requiring attention in the immediate
future, he sailed from Singapore in July, and arrived in
England early in October.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now honours rained on him. He was presented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>with the freedom of the City of London; Oxford University
conferred upon him the degree of LL.D.; he was graciously
received at Windsor by the Queen and the Prince Consort;
was appointed Governor of Labuan, and Commissioner
and Consul-General in Borneo, and made a K.C.B.<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c011'><sup>[152]</sup></a> The
United Service, the Army and Navy, the Athenæum,
Travellers, and other Clubs elected him an honorary
member. He was lionised and fêted, and was received
with marked distinction by every one, including Ministers.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sailed from England on February 1, 1848, with
his Labuan staff, in the <em>Mæander</em>, commanded by his old
friend and ally, Captain Keppel, and having the present
Rajah on board as sub-lieutenant.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c011'><sup>[153]</sup></a> After spending a few
months in Singapore making preparations for the establishment
of his new colony, he arrived at the Muaratebas
entrance of the Sarawak river in September; here he left
the <em>Mæander</em>, and was triumphantly escorted up-river by
the whole Kuching population amidst general rejoicings.</p>

<p class='c000'>He found affairs in his little raj had not been conducted
quite so well as he could have wished, and that there were
evidences of renewed activity on the part of the pirates.
Pangiran Makota was in power at Bruni, and that was a
menace to the good conduct of both the external and
internal affairs of the Sultanate. The Sultan had been
in direct communication with the Sekrang Dayaks, amongst
whom both Sherip Mular and Sherip Ahmit were busy
intriguing, and collecting the dissatisfied party which had
been scattered. Hostile operations on the part of the
Saribas were only checked by the arrival of the <em>Mæander</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>On September 14, the Rajah was joined by his nephew,
Captain James Brooke-Johnson,<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c011'><sup>[154]</sup></a> of the Connaught Rangers,
as his official A.D.C. He assumed the surname of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>uncle, and was given the title of Tuan Besar. Although
he was always looked upon as the heir-presumptive, the
title of Rajah Muda was only conferred upon him when
he was officially and publicly recognised by the Rajah as
his heir in 1861.</p>

<p class='c000'>"To give a spirit of national pride to the natives," the
Rajah now granted the country a flag,<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c011'><sup>[155]</sup></a> and this was hoisted
with due ceremony on September 21. Viscount Palmerston,
in a despatch dated June 20, 1849, subsequently conveyed
the approval of H.M.'s Government of the flag having been
hoisted, in order, with the sanction of the British Government,
to afford a recognised permanency to the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah then sailed in the <em>Mæander</em> to Labuan,
where he was busy for some time arranging and organising
the colony, but, falling a victim, with many others, to the
insalubrity of the climate, he took a sea voyage in the
<em>Mæander</em>, visiting several places on the north-west coast
and passing on to Sulu, where he established friendly
relations with the Sultan, and paved the way to a treaty
being effected, by which Sulu would be placed within the
sphere of British influence. He returned to Labuan in
January, 1849, nearly recovered, and the next month was
back in Sarawak again, to face an anxious time, a year of
trouble and strife.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah had done all he could in England to move
the British Government to take energetic action effectually
to stamp out piracy, especially in regard to the Saribas
and Sekrang, amongst whom the peaceable party had now
been completely overborne by the piratical faction, and this
would have been prevented had the British Government
sanctioned the Rajah's scheme of building a fort in the
disturbed district. Alone, he was powerless to effect much,
if anything. The <em>Mæander</em> had been specially fitted for
taking action against these pirates, and her captain specially
appointed on account of the experience he had already
gained in dealing with them, as it was intended that the
frigate should be detailed for this service; but trouble having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>occurred in China, she was recalled by the Admiral, and the
Rajah was left with the H.E.I.C. <em>Nemesis</em> only, a steamer
quite inadequate for the purpose; and, being required to
keep up communication between Labuan and Singapore,
her station being at the latter place, she could be only
occasionally placed at his disposal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The departure of the <em>Mæander</em>, and the Rajah's long
absence in the north, had emboldened the Saribas and
Sekrangs to prepare for fresh atrocities. Their insolence
had, moreover, so increased that they went so far as to send
the Rajah a message of defiance, daring him to come out
against them, taunting him with cowardice, and comparing
him to a woman.<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c011'><sup>[156]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On March 2nd, the Rajah received news that a large
pirate fleet of one hundred prahus had put to sea, and,
after having captured several trading vessels, the crews of
which they had put to death, had proceeded up the Sadong
river, where they had killed upwards of one hundred or
more Malay men, women, and children, and had carried
others into slavery. Within the three previous months
they had killed three hundred persons, burnt several villages,
and captured numerous prahus.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c011'><sup>[157]</sup></a> This expedition was led
by the Laksamana, the Malay chief of the Saribas;<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c011'><sup>[158]</sup></a> it was
checked at the town of Gedong, which was well prepared
for defence, and too much on the alert to be taken by
surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>An artifice of these pirates, and they never attempted
by force what could be acquired by stratagem, was this:
some of the party remained behind and assumed the clothes
of their victims, and the umbrella-shaped hats of palm
leaf commonly used by those harvesting in the sun, which
would completely conceal their features; thus disguised they
paddled down stream, and called in Malay to the women to
issue from their hiding-places, as they had come to convey
them to a place of safety. The poor creatures, supposing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>that these were of their own tribe, ran down with their
children in their arms only to be speared and their heads
hacked off by these wolves in sheep's clothing.<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c011'><sup>[159]</sup></a> On the last
day of February, a numerous and industrious population
was gathering in the harvest, and on March the 1st every
house was plundered, and scattered about the fields were the
mangled bodies of the reapers, and in the villages lay the
headless trunks of men, aged women, and children too young
for captivity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not a day passed without news reaching Kuching of
some village burned or of some trading vessel captured.
After the attack on Sadong, while the Saribas hovered along
the coast, crowds of refugees arrived in Kuching. From all
parts they came; from the river of Matu alone twenty
prahus full of men, women, and children, and from Kalaka
many hundreds. They said that they could endure life
no longer in their own country, continually engaged in
resisting these murderous attacks, and losing numbers of
their people at the hands of the Sekrangs and Saribas.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No news except of Dayaks, and rumours of Dayaks.
Dayaks here, Dayaks there, and Dayaks everywhere," so
wrote the Rajah.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Kalaka river had also been laid waste. Hunt in
1812 described Kalaka as being one of the principal ports
of trade on the north-west coast,<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c011'><sup>[160]</sup></a> and the country as producing
large quantities of grain. But this was before the
Sea-Dayaks had become pirates. In 1849, the river had
been so devastated by piratical attacks that all cultivation
had been abandoned, and its once flourishing town and
villages deserted, with the exception of two that were small.
"Never before had I been so struck with the irreparable
mischief done by the piratical tribes, as when I saw this
lovely country so completely deserted," so wrote Mr. S.
St. John in 1849.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ravages of these murderous Dayaks had been
peculiarly destructive in the delta of the Rejang, once well
populated by the quiet and industrious Melanaus, the producers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>of the Bornean sago brought to the market of
Singapore. The pirates not only destroyed the villages
and plantations, but captured many richly laden prahus,
freighted with the produce of this district on their way
to dispose of their lading in the British Settlement of
Singapore, and in Sambas and Pontianak. Like the Malays
of Kalaka, nearly all the inhabitants had fled, most to
Sarawak, some to other places.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the first six months of 1849, some 600 persons
fell victims to these savages; it must be borne in mind that
the districts inhabited by these people and those attacked
by them were then in Bruni territory, and outside the raj
of Sarawak.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1849, it was reckoned that the Saribas had 6000
fighting men, the Sekrangs an equal number, and those
Sekrangs and Saribas who had moved across to the Kanowit,
Katibas, and Poi, affluents of the Rejang river, could muster
8000 warriors,<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c011'><sup>[161]</sup></a> making, with their Malay allies, a total of
25,000 men living on piracy and murder. Secure on their
rivers, in their stockades, in their jungles, in their large and
well-constructed boats, and in their numbers, they scoffed at
warnings, and proceeded from crime to crime until the
whole country from Bruni to Sarawak was nearly their own.</p>

<p class='c000'>In desperation, and with the hope of checking these
outrages, the Rajah at once started against the pirates
with his own little flotilla of some twenty-four war prahus
manned by 800 Malays, but he was driven back by the
north-east monsoon, perhaps fortunately, as his force was
totally inadequate. Then the <em>Nemesis</em>, under Commander
Wallage, arrived, and the Rajah, feeling he was now strong
enough to effect something, sallied forth again on March 25,
with the same native force and four of the boats of the
<em>Nemesis</em>. The bala<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c011'><sup>[162]</sup></a> was augmented by eighty-four native
prahus with over 2000 friendlies, all thirsting for revenge.
Both branches of the Kalaka were ascended, and from
the left-hand branch the native levies crossed over into the
Rembas, a large affluent of the Saribas, and here several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>strongholds were destroyed, with large quantities of rice and
salt; the enemy were, however, absent on an expedition, and
but few fighting men were left behind. The Rajah then
proceeded up the Saribas, the entrance of which the <em>Nemesis</em>
had been sent on to guard, and at the mouth of the Rembas
branch met a large force of Saribas Dayaks which hurriedly
retreated. These were on their way to effect a junction
with the Sekrangs, the Malay town of Banting up the
Lingga being the objective. Ten prahus of Sadong
friendlies on their way home were met and attacked at
night by these Sekrangs, who had a force of 150 bangkongs,
but, the Balau Dayaks opportunely coming to the assistance
of the former, the Sekrangs were defeated and driven back
to their own country. This well-contrived expedition then
terminated in a return to Sarawak, and though the pirates
had not suffered any great loss, especially in lives, a severe
check had been administered, and by preventing a junction
between the Saribas and Sekrangs their piratical venture for
that occasion had been spoiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>After his return from this expedition the Rajah took
advantage of the lull that was certain to follow, for the
Dayaks would lie low for a time fully expecting to be again
attacked, and proceeded to visit his little colony at Labuan.
From thence he passed on to Sulu, where he concluded a
commercial treaty with the Sultan, returning to Kuching at
the end of May. In the meantime Admiral Sir Francis
Collier had despatched the <em>Albatross</em>, Commander Farquhar,<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c011'><sup>[163]</sup></a>
to Sarawak, to take the <em>Mæander's</em> place, and she had
arrived at Kuching before the Rajah's return in the <em>Nemesis</em>,
and had there been joined by the <em>Royalist</em>, Lieutenant
Everest. Preparations were pushed forward to deliver a
final blow to the Saribas and Sekrang pirates, who, now the
Ramathan, or fast month, had commenced, considered themselves
safe, under the firm persuasion that the Rajah would
not move against them so long as it lasted, out of regard
for the religious scruples of the Malays.</p>

<p class='c000'>The expedition started on July 24. It comprised the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span><em>Nemesis</em>, the <em>Royalist</em>, and the <em>Ranee</em> (the <em>Mæander's</em> little
steam tender), seven men-of-war boats, and the Rajah's
Malay force of eighteen war prahus manned by 640 Malays.
At the mouth detachments of Lundu and Balau Sea-Dayaks,
and Malays from Samarahan and Sadong joined, which
brought the native force up to a total of seventy prahus with
2500 men. The <em>Royalist</em> was towed by the <em>Nemesis</em> into
the Batang Lupar, and left to guard that river off the mouth
of the Lingga, and the latter went on to the entrance of the
Saribas, where, with the ships' boats, she took up her position.
The main force joined her on the 28th, and the same
evening information was received that a large piratical bala,
under the command of the Datu Patinggi of Saribas and the
principal Malays, had left the Saribas two days previously
and had gone northwards. The Rajah and Captain
Farquhar immediately determined to intercept them on their
return. With twelve war prahus and two men-of-war
cutters the Rajah took up a position across the mouth of
the Kalaka, to prevent the pirates gaining their way home
by that river. The <em>Nemesis</em>, with the rest of the force,
blocked the Saribas, and the only other route open to them
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">via</span></i> the Batang Lupar was guarded by the <em>Royalist</em>. There
was an alternative way back, a long one, up the Rejang and
Kanowit, but they were not likely to take this. On the
evening of the 31st, a rocket sent up from the <em>Rajah
Singha</em>,<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c011'><sup>[164]</sup></a> the Rajah's war prahu, announced the approach of
the enemy. They came on boldly, and, perceiving the force
at the entrance of the Kalaka, but not the more formidable
one hidden by the long promontory separating the mouths
of the two rivers, dashed on for the Saribas with defiant
yells, to encounter in the growing darkness greater peril,
and thus commenced the most famous fight in the Sarawak
annals, which brought a just retribution on these savage
pirates and for ever broke their power, the battle of Beting
Maru.<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c011'><sup>[165]</sup></a> Met with showers of grape, cannister, rockets,
and musketry from the <em>Nemesis</em> and the boats, and the
savage onslaughts of the native levies mad for revenge, well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>led by the Rajah's English and Malay officers, and with
their retreat intercepted by the Rajah's division, the pirates
were soon thrown into confusion, and thought only of
escape. But cut off in all directions, for five hours, in
bright moonlight, they had to sustain a series of encounters
extending over a distance of ten miles. At midnight all
was over. About a dozen bangkongs escaped, whilst over
a hundred were destroyed, and the enemy had lost about
300 killed. This loss would have been far heavier had the
Rajah allowed his native forces to intercept the retreat of the
great numbers who had landed and escaped into the jungle,
and this could have easily been effected; as it was, 500
died of wounds, exposure, and starvation, or were cut off
before they could reach their homes. Of those who
succeeded in escaping up the Saribas that night was the
famous Dayak chief Linggir, who, with seventeen war-boats,
had made a desperate attack on the <em>Nemesis</em>, which resulted
in the destruction of all the boats with their crews except
his.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c011'><sup>[166]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Had this expedition started but a few days earlier, the
mischief that had been done would have been prevented,
though that mischief was far less than it would have been had
not the pirates been forced to beat a hasty retreat on receiving
news that so powerful a force was out against them.
They had attacked Matu, but that town was found to be
too well prepared to be carried without considerable loss, and,
their aim being not glory but to procure heads, captives, and
plunder, with the least possible risk to themselves, they
retreated in search of easier prey after sustaining a loss of
ten killed, but not before they had taken a detached house
in which they obtained seven heads and captured four girls.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Palo they had plundered, and had there seized three girls;<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c011'><sup>[167]</sup></a>
they spared the place as being the main source of their salt
supply. Two vessels trading to Singapore were captured,
and the crew of one were all killed. Serikei proved too strong
for them. A detachment had gone westward, and off
Sambas they killed some Chinese fishermen and took their
heads. At Sirhasan, one of the Natuna islands, they
captured a trading vessel, and on their way back to join
the main fleet attacked the Malays living at the mouth of
Muaratebas, but were repulsed after a desperate fight. A
trading prahu was there seized, the owner and five of the
crew being killed. Coming across Abang Husin, a nephew
of the Datu Temanggong, they killed him and his boat's
crew of six, after a gallant defence.</p>

<p class='c000'>A couple of days having been spent in destroying the
captured bangkongs and securing prisoners, the expedition
proceeded up the Saribas river. After some exciting
episodes and hard work in cutting their way through
innumerable trees, which had been felled across the river to
impede their progress, the force reached Paku, which was
taken and burnt for the second time. The expedition then
proceeded up the Rejang, to punish the Sekrang Dayaks
living in the Kanowit. Eighteen villages were destroyed,
and the country laid waste for a hundred miles. This done,
the Rajah returned to Kuching with the whole force, arriving
there on August the 24th. With him came many
Serikei people, who wished to escape from the tyranny of
Sherip Masahor,<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c011'><sup>[168]</sup></a> an infamous and intriguing half-bred Arab
chief, who appears to have but lately settled in the Rejang
as the Bruni governor, and who in the near future was to
cause the Sarawak Government considerable trouble.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the battle of Beting Maru, the well-inclined Malay
and Dayak chiefs of the Sekrang were once more raised to
power, and the Rajah built a fort at Sekrang, of which
Sherip Matusain, who has been before mentioned as having
taken a prominent part on the side of the Sarawak Malays
in the rebellion against Bruni, was placed in charge. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>fort was built to uphold the friendly and non-piratical party
against the interior piratical tribes, to prevent the latter
passing down to the sea, and as a position for the advancement
of commerce. It was built entirely by Sekrang
Malays and Dayaks under the supervision of Mr. Crookshank,
and when Mr. Brereton<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c011'><sup>[169]</sup></a> went there shortly afterwards to
take charge, at the request of the natives that a European
might be placed over them, he was entirely dependent on
their goodwill, having no force of any sort, to support his
authority.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Saribas and the Sekrangs now submitted, the
former too utterly broken to do further mischief by sea, and
the latter frightened by the lesson that had been administered
to their allies and themselves,<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c011'><sup>[170]</sup></a> and by the establishment of a
Government station in their district. Such was the effect of
this chastisement that piracy was almost completely put an end
to in these turbulent tribes; then had the land rest to recover,
the waste places to revive, the towns to be rebuilt, and the
population to increase. In but a very few years the bulk of
these very tribes which had been the scourge of the country
were reduced to peaceable and industrious citizens.</p>

<p class='c000'>But trouble far-reaching, on which he had not calculated,
was in store for the Rajah through this expedition. It came
at a time when he was weakened in health from continuous
exposure and the severe strain he had undergone, which had
brought him near death's door, and it came from a quarter
the least expected. He "had risked life, given money, and
sacrificed health to effect a great object;"<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c011'><sup>[171]</sup></a> and had made
the coast from cape Datu to Marudu bay as safe as the
English Channel to vessels of all flags and all sizes, and now he
had to bear with the malicious tongues and persecutions of
the humanity-mongers of England, who were first prompted
to attack the Rajah by his discarded agent, Mr. Wise. This
man was embittered against the Rajah for his refusal to sell
Sarawak to a company; by being called to account for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>loss he had caused the Rajah of some thousands of pounds;
and by some unfavourable comments the Rajah had made
on his actions, which had come to his knowledge owing to
certain private letters of the Rajah not intended for his eyes
having fallen into his hands. Wise had offered to make the
Rajah "one of the richest commoners in England," and
presumedly saw his way to becoming one too, but the Rajah
preferred "the real interests of Sarawak and the plain
dictates of duty to the golden baited hook."<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c011'><sup>[172]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Cobden, Hume, Sidney Herbert, and afterwards Gladstone,
as well as others of that faction, took up the cause of the
pirates, and the Rajah and the naval officers who had been
engaged since 1843 in suppressing the Saribas and Sekrangs
were attacked with acrimony as butchers of peaceful and
harmless natives—and all for the sake of extending the
Sarawak raj. The <cite>Spectator</cite> and the <cite>Daily News</cite> bitterly
assailed the Rajah, relying upon information supplied through
the medium of a Singapore newspaper; and the Peace
Society and the Aborigines Protection Society, laid on a
false scent by those whom they should not have trusted,
became scurrilous in their advocacy of cold-blooded murderers
and pirates.</p>

<p class='c000'>After having brought the "<em>cruel butchery</em>" of Beting
Maru to the attention of the House of Commons on three
occasions, Joseph Hume, on July 12, 1850, moved an address
to her Majesty, bringing to the notice of the House "one of
the most atrocious massacres that had ever taken place in his
time." He supported the motion with glaring and wilful
mis-statements, and brought disgraceful charges against the
Rajah, whom he branded as "the promoter of deeds of bloodshed
and cruelty." The Navy he charged with wholesale
murder, and the poor victims of the massacre he described as
a harmless and timid people.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c011'><sup>[173]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Cobden, who supported the motion, called the battle of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Beting Maru a human battue, than which there was never
anything more unprovoked. He could not do homage to
the Rajah as a great philanthropist seeing that he had no
other argument for the savages than extermination.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah was ably defended by Mr. Henry Drummond,
who exposed Wise's conduct; and the motion was lost by
a majority of 140 in a House of 198.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Birmingham, Cobden asserted that the Rajah, "who
had gone out to the Eastern Archipelago as a private
adventurer, had seized upon a territory as large as Yorkshire,
and then drove out the natives; and who, under the pretence
that they were pirates, subsequently sent for our fleet and
men to massacre them ... the atrocities perpetrated by
Sir James Brooke in Borneo had been continually quoted
in the Austrian newspapers as something which threw into
the shade the horrible atrocities of Haynau himself."</p>

<p class='c000'>The following year, on July 10, Hume moved for a
Royal Commission to enquire into the proceedings of Sir
James Brooke, but this was negatived by 230 votes to 19.
He went a little further this time, and drew harrowing
pictures of "cruel butcheries, and brutal murders of the
helpless and defenceless." Sir James Brooke, he said,
attacked none but the poor Dayaks, and even their wives
and children were destroyed. He even went so far as to
deny that the Saribas were head-hunters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gladstone bore high testimony to the Rajah's character
and motives. His entire confidence in the Rajah's
honour and integrity led him to accept his statements with
unqualified and unreserved belief. He adjudged the Dayaks
of being addicted to barbarous warfare and piracy, and
maintained that there were not sufficient grounds for the
motion, against which he voted. He, however, contended
that most of the pirates were killed when not resisting,
and had been deliberately sacrificed in the act of fleeing.
This unhappily gave rise to doubts, which subsequently
caused him to entirely change his opinions, and to completely
veer round to the other side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord Palmerston denounced the charges against the
Rajah "as malignant and persevering persecution of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>honourable man," and Mr. Drummond rightly denied
"that, from beginning to end, this motion had any other
foundation than a personal determination to ruin Sir James
Brooke." "The whole of this transaction from first to last
was a very discreditable affair," he said. "The gentlemen
of England echoed him,"<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c011'><sup>[174]</sup></a> and the nation too, judging by
the tone of the press, which (with the exception of one or
two papers), from <cite>The Times</cite> downwards, supported the
Rajah.<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c011'><sup>[175]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Her Majesty's Government had notified the Rajah of
their approval of all he had done, and he was instructed to
follow the same course should a similar necessity arise.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Wise, Hume, Cobden, and their adherents were only
checked, and, huffed by their defeats, continued their efforts
to ruin the Rajah's character and administration with increased
bitterness, unfortunately in the end to obtain a
partial success; but we will leave this subject for a while, to
turn briefly to events in Sarawak.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a commentary on Mr. Cobden's assertion that the
natives were being driven out of Sarawak, the population of
the raj in 1850 had increased to 50,000 from 8000 in
1840, and this increase was due to immigration from the
neighbouring countries, where the people had been the constant
prey of pirates, head-hunters, and their own oppressive
rulers, and for these over-burdened people the Rajah had
supplied a haven. The Chinese colony in upper Sarawak
was augmented by the arrival of five thousand Chinese
refugees from Pemangkat in Dutch territory, who had come
to Sarawak to escape the tyranny of their more powerful
neighbours and rivals, the Chinese of Montrado. These
latter had successfully rebelled against the authority of the
Dutch, and were now oppressing their weaker neighbours,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>both Chinese and Dayak. The Kayan and Kenyahs of the
Baram, who had been in rebellion against the Sultan,
had sent messages offering to accept the Rajah as their
chief, and those of the Rejang assisted in building the new
fort at the mouth of the Kanowit. This fort was erected by
the Rajah to protect the inhabitants of the Rejang delta, and
of Oya and Muka, by blocking the egress by the Kanowit river
to the Sekrang and Saribas Dayaks. All these countries,
including the Sekrang, where a station had already been
established, were under the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de jure</span></i> rule of the Sultan, but
the inhabitants now looked upon the Rajah as their ruler.
The Sultan had long been helpless to govern the disturbed
districts; his authority was not recognised by the population,
and the chiefs appointed by him acted to gain their own
ends, the enriching of themselves at the expense of the people.
The Sultan had placed himself in the Rajah's hands, and
was well pleased that he should pacify and introduce order
into these districts, more perhaps in his own interests than
in those of his own people, for whose welfare he cared little;
they paid him no revenue, and that he hoped the Rajah
would secure for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bandar Kasim, in spite of warnings, was again oppressing
his people in the Sadong. The Rajah had deposed him in
1848, and had appointed his brother, Abang Leman,<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c011'><sup>[176]</sup></a> in his
place, but the change brought no benefit to the people, it
gave them but an additional tyrant, for both were now
behaving badly, and the Bandar had to be removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>After visiting Labuan, the Rajah went to Penang for a
much-needed change, and there received instructions from
the Foreign Office to proceed to Siam on a diplomatic mission.
He left for Bangkok in August. To quote his own words:
"The mission was a dead failure, as the Siamese are as
hostile and opposed to Europeans as any people can well
be. I had a very trying time of it, and altogether got rid of
an unpleasant and critical position without loss of national
and individual credit." A short time before an American
mission had also been similarly repulsed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>During the Rajah's absence, an envoy from the United
States had arrived at Kuching bearing a letter from the
President addressed to him as Sovereign Prince of Sarawak,
and expressing a desire to enter into friendly relations. The
envoy informed the Rajah by letter that having been entrusted
with full powers he was ready to sign a treaty with Sarawak,
and that he was to thank the Rajah "in the name of the
American nation for his exertions in the suppression of
piracy," and to compliment him on his noble and "humane
endeavours to bring his subjects and the neighbouring tribes
of Malays into a condition of civilisation." Lord Palmerston
saw no objection to the Rajah entering into diplomatic
relations as Rajah of Sarawak with the United States.<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c011'><sup>[177]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In January, 1851, the Rajah, leaving Captain Brooke in
charge, again left for England on account of the bad state of
his health. He came home for rest and quiet, but this was
denied him, and he had to sum up all his energies, and
expend time and money to contend against the active and
bitter hostility of his Radical opponents in England, who in
spite of adverse majorities in the House of Commons and
the opposition of some of the most prominent politicians in
both Houses, continued their malignant persecution with
great persistency both in and out of Parliament.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1853, the Aberdeen coalition Ministry came into
power, which, like all coalitions, was feeble and lived by
compromise. This Ministry agreed to give what Hume and
his faction asked, and had thrice been refused by the
House by large majorities,<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c011'><sup>[178]</sup></a> a commission of enquiry into
the conduct of the Rajah, before which he was to be called
upon to defend himself against allegations scouted by the
House, the incorrectness of which could be proved by the
leading statesmen of the day, including such men as the
Earl of Derby, Earl Grey, Viscount Palmerston, and Lord
John Russell.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c011'><sup>[179]</sup></a> The Ministry most disingenuously kept their
decision a secret from the Rajah until after he had left
England, though not from Hume, who was able to send
information to his coadjutors in Singapore that it was granted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>They had got up an address to him, by the most unscrupulous
devices, expressing disapproval of all that he had done, and
urging that an enquiry might be instituted into the conduct of
the Rajah by a Commission sent from England. This address
was purported to have been signed by fifty-three merchants
of Singapore. Afterwards, when the Commission sat in
Singapore, only twenty-seven merchant firms were found to
exist there, and of these twenty-two had signed an address
of confidence in the Rajah. Some of those who had signed
the address to Hume, and who put in an appearance before
the Commission, exposed the way in which their signatures
had been obtained by misrepresentations.</p>

<p class='c000'>On April 30th, 1852, a great dinner was given to the
Rajah at the London Tavern, to mark the sense entertained
of the eminent services rendered by him in the interests of
commerce and humanity, by his endeavours to put down the
evils of piracy in the Eastern Archipelago, and by his
labours to advance civilisation in that part of the world.
The company, which numbered two hundred, included
members of Parliament, Governors of the Bank of England,
East India Company Directors, officers in the Army and
Navy, and many others.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Rajah delivered a speech, which, for truth and feeling,
language and action, will never be forgotten by those who had the
privilege of hearing him; ... and the feeling was current that
should a crisis ever arise in the fortunes of this country, he would
be the man of action, who ought forthwith to be called to the
councils of the nation.<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c011'><sup>[180]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Only the opening passages of this speech can be given,
made in response to the toast of his health:—</p>

<p class='c013'>I will not pretend, gentlemen, to that species of pride which apes
humility. I will not say that I am wholly unworthy of your regard,
but I will tell you something of the position I hold in the East.
Your approval of my conduct is no light condemnation of the conduct
of those who have sought by every means, fair or unfair, to
blast my reputation, even at the risk of injuring their own; who
under the pretence of humanity have screened injustice, and on the
plea of enquiry, have been unscrupulous enough to charge murder.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>It is now but a little more than five years since I was the idol of a
spurious popularity; it is more than three years that I have been the
object, but happily not the victim, of an unprecedented persecution,
and it will afford me no light satisfaction if this night a fair and
moderate estimate can be formed of my motives and conduct.
Praise and blame have been lavished upon me with no sparing hand.
I have been accused of every crime from murder to merchandise.
I have been held up as a prodigy of perfection, and I have been cast
down as a monster of iniquity. These, gentlemen, are the extremes
which human folly delights in; these are the distortions which the
tribunes of the people represent as Bible truths to the multitude,
these the delusions which a hackneyed politician uses lightly, to
wound feelings he has long outlived, and to cast a slur upon Her
Majesty's servants. The evil, I fear, is inevitable, but it is no less
an evil, that public morals, in such hands, should sink like water to
its lowest and dirtiest level.</p>

<p class='c000'>In replying for the Bench, the Hon. Baron Alderson
said:—</p>

<p class='c013'>I am sorry to say that in one respect I differ from Sir James
Brooke and the Chairman, in that they expressed something of regret
that our distinguished guest had not the approbation of all mankind.
I do not think Sir James Brooke would deserve it if he had it; for
I have always observed—and I believe history will confirm me—that
the greatest benefactors of the human race have been the most
abused in their own time, and I therefore think Sir James Brooke
ought to be congratulated <em>because</em> he is abused.</p>

<p class='c000'>In England, especially, it is the case that the little men
who bray their philanthropic sentiments on platforms are
almost always found in opposition to and decrying those
men who are doing mighty deeds for the advancement and
happiness of mankind. There exists in narrow minds a
mean pleasure in decrying those who tower above them
intellectually and morally. They do not blow themselves
up to equal the ox, but they spit their poison at him in
hopes of bringing him down to their level. And the unfortunate
result of the weakness of party government is that
the party which is in power is always, or almost always,
ready to throw over a great public servant to silence the
yelping of the pack that snarl about his heels. It was so
with Governor Eyre, it was so with Sir Bartle Frere, it was
so with General Gordon, and it was so with Sir Bampfylde
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Fuller. "The time will come in our country when no
gentleman will serve the public, and your blackguards and
your imbeciles may have a monopoly of appointments," so in
indignant sorrow wrote the Rajah. Though surprised and
hurt at what had been said and done, he was not disturbed,
and he treated his defamers with contempt and indifference,
"conscious of right motives, and firm in right action."<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c011'><sup>[181]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah left England in April, 1853. On his arrival
in Sarawak he was attacked by small-pox. There was no
doctor in Kuching at the time, but he was successfully
nursed through his illness by his devoted officers, both
English and native, amongst the latter being Sherip Matusain,
who had lately been recalled from Sekrang in disgrace, and
who now became one of his doctors. Prayers for his
recovery were nightly offered in the mosque, and Malay
houses. Offerings for his recovery were made in the shape
of alms by the Indians; and votive oblations were made in
their temples by the Chinese. The Rev. A. Horsburgh, who
did so much to pull him through his illness, wrote:—</p>

<p class='c013'>The joy in Sarawak when all danger was over was very great,
for all had been equally distressed, and many fervent prayers in
church, mosque, and temple, were offered for his recovery.</p>

<p class='c000'>But we will here briefly interrupt the sequence of events
to give in unbroken record the sequel that happily
terminated the unprecedented persecutions which the Rajah
was subjected to for over five years, for the miserable fiasco
of the Commission, the direct result of these persecutions, left
the Rajah's defamers powerless and humiliated, and the
Government in a disgraceful dilemma.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Commission sat in Singapore during the months of
September and October, 1854. It consisted of two gentlemen,
Mr. C. R. Prinsep, Advocate-General at Calcutta,
already afflicted with the mental malady to which he
soon after succumbed, and the Hon. Humphrey B.
Devereaux, of the Bengal Civil Service. At the first and
second meetings, of which due notice had been given, to the
surprise of the Commissioners no one appeared to support
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>the charges contained in the address to Mr. Hume, and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">subpœnas</span> had to be served on several of the subscribers to
that address. As a result, sixteen witnesses were produced
in support of these charges, and not one of them deposed
to any acts within his own knowledge which negatived the
practice of piracy by the Saribas and Sekrangs; three
deposed to specific piratical acts of those tribes; and one
rather established than controverted their piratical character.
On the other hand, twenty-four witnesses called by the
Commissioners, with Mr. J. Bondriot,<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c011'><sup>[182]</sup></a> late Resident of
Sambas, Dutch Borneo (who volunteered his evidence)
deposed expressly to acts of piracy on the part of these
people. Traders and nakodas from Borneo, who were
present in Singapore, were deterred from coming forward to
give evidence by reports disseminated amongst them by the
personal opponents of the Rajah that their attendance would
lead to detention and inconvenience. The contention that
the attacks of the Saribas and Sekrang Dayaks were merely
acts of intertribal hostility was not upheld. The charge of
wrongful and causeless attack and massacre wholly failed
of proof, and was sufficiently negatived.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c011'><sup>[183]</sup></a> This was the
judgment of Mr. Prinseps, and so far his brother Commissioner
was with him, for, after dealing with their general
character, Mr. Devereaux sums up by saying that the Saribas
and Sekrang were piratical, and deserved the punishment
they received, and that in conflicts with such men atrocities,
in the ordinary sense of the term, are not easily committed.<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c011'><sup>[184]</sup></a>
These were the main points which mostly concerned the
public, and upon which were based the grave accusations
that it had been the pleasure of Mr. Hume and his adherents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>to formulate upon totally inadequate and most unreliable
evidence. The other points brought by their instructions to
the notice of the Commissioners were matters more between
the Crown and the Rajah than of general interest to the
public. Whether the position of Sir James Brooke as Rajah
of Sarawak was compatible with his duties as British Consul
General and Commissioner, and with his character as a
British subject; was the Rajah engaged in trade? and
whether the Rajah should be entrusted with a discretion to
determine which tribes are piratical, and to call for the aid
of her Majesty's Naval forces for the punishment of such
tribes, were points upon which the Commissioners had to
decide, and upon which they differed. They, however, agreed
that the Rajah was not engaged in trade, and the other
questions, except the involved one of the independence of
Sarawak, had been solved by the Rajah's resignation of his
appointments under the Crown, which was, however, only
accepted late in 1855, long after he had in weariness of
spirit ceased to exercise the functions of those offices.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Upon the question of the independence of Sarawak, Mr.
Prinseps found the Rajah's position to be no other than that
of a vassal of the Sultan, holding indeed by a tenure very
bare, and easy to be thrown off altogether." Mr. Devereaux
could give no definite opinion; but it was a question to be
submitted only to the highest legal authorities, and the Rajah
justly protested against the Commissioners dealing with it;
and it is a question that has long since been settled.</p>

<p class='c000'>One result of this senseless outcry in England against
the Rajah was that no help was thenceforth accorded him
by the fleet in the China and Straits waters. Were an
insurrection to take place; were the Sekrangs and Saribas
to send round the calling-out spear and muster their clans,
not a marine, not a gun would have been afforded him by her
Majesty's Government for his protection, and such was the
case during the Chinese insurrection.</p>

<p class='c000'>An evidence of the confidence felt after the quelling of
the pirates was the increase in trade, the tonnage of merchant
vessels in 1852 having risen to 25,000 tons, whereas in
1842 the whole trade was carried on by a few native prahus.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Traders were secure along the coast, and, as was testified to
before the Commission, the people of Sambas and Pontianak
blessed the Rajah for the protection he had given them
against the depredations of the piratical Dayaks; and those
of Muka and Oya were thankful that he had settled near
them—a little later they had more reason to be thankful,
when he relieved them of their oppressive rulers. The
Singapore <cite>Free Press</cite> in February, 1850, said:—</p>

<p class='c013'>A few, a very few years ago, no European merchant vessels
ventured on the north-west coast of Borneo; now they are numerous
and safe. Formerly shipwrecked crews were attacked, robbed, and
enslaved; now they are protected, fed, and forwarded to a place of
safety. The native trade now passes with careless indifference over
the same track between Marudu and Singapore where, but a little
while ago, it was liable to the peril of capture; the crews of
hundreds of prahus are no longer exposed to the loss of life and the
loss of property. The recent successful proceedings on the coast of
Borneo have been followed by the submission of the pirate hordes
of Saribas and Sekrang.</p>

<p class='c000'>So late as June, 1877, when the Rajah had long been
dead, Mr. Gladstone in addressing the House on the question
of Turkey and Bulgarian atrocities, and probably as a comparison,
said, "I cannot recollect a more shameful proceeding
on the part of any country than the slaughter of the Dayaks
by Her Majesty's forces and by Sir James Brooke."</p>

<p class='c000'>Earl Grey and Admiral Farquhar published indignant
replies. Mr. Bailie-Cochrane<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c011'><sup>[185]</sup></a> took Mr. Gladstone to task
in the House, whereupon the latter shuffled out of what he
had said with less than his usual ingenuity, by saying that
he never meant to blame the Rajah personally, but only the
Government. The following is from Earl Grey's reply:—</p>

<p class='c013'>The additional information respecting him which I have since
gained has only tended to confirm the impression I then received
that his character was a truly noble one, and I am sanguine enough
to believe that it would be regarded in the same light by yourself if
you would be induced to read the letters he addressed to his mother
in the early part of his career as Rajah of Sarawak. These, to my
mind, most beautiful letters are to be found in the very interesting
life of Sir James Brooke published some months ago by Miss Jacob.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>They were written while the events they describe were going on, to a
mother whom he passionately loved, obviously without the remotest
idea that they would ever be published, and contain an account,
bearing the clearest impress of truth and sincerity of all that he did,
and of the feelings and motives by which he was guided. We find
in them a touching record of his pity for the oppressed Dayaks,<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c011'><sup>[186]</sup></a> of
his righteous indignation against the oppressors, of his noble self-devotion,
and of his fixed determination to hazard, and if necessary
to sacrifice for their welfare, not only the whole of his moderate
fortune, but ease, health, and life itself, while he steadily refused to
listen to all attempts that were made to induce him to use the
position he had acquired for his own personal advantage.</p>

<p>ATTACK ON S. USMAN'S STRONGHOLD.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Commission had done no serious harm with his own
loyal people. They heard with bewilderment that the man
on whom their prosperity, and indeed their security, depended,
had been maligned in England, and was to be tried as a
malefactor in Singapore, and their dread was lest he should be
taken from their head, or should throw up his task in disgust,
and the country be allowed to relapse into oppression and
anarchy; for so surely as the Rajah left, would the pangirans
return and resume their blood-sucking operations on one side,
and on the other the pirates recover from their humiliation
and recommence their depredations, and so they would perish
between the upper and nether millstone.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ministry made no attempt to remove the harmful
impressions caused by the false step they had so weakly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>been induced to take; they but confirmed these by making
no <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amende</span></i>, and by withdrawing all support, and as the sequel
will show, the Commission paved the way for the rebellion
of the Chinese, and for the outbreak of disaffected Malays
and other natives, aided and incited by intriguing Brunis,
which were to follow, and which cost the lives of many
Europeans, and great numbers of Chinese and natives, and
nearly resulted in the extinction of the raj. With justice the
Rajah wrote: "It is a sad thing to say, but true as sad,
that England has been the worst opponent of the progress
of Sarawak, and is now the worst enemy of her liberty."</p>

be friendly, for they were completely at the mercy of the Dayaks. They entertained
their unwelcome guests with wine and cigars whilst waiting for the Datus, to whom
the Rajah had contrived covertly to send a message. The Datu Temanggong arrived
first with thirty men, and then came the Datu Bandar with fifty men. The Datus
wished to kill Linggir for his intended treachery, the Rajah, however, spared him,
perhaps unwisely, but he had to slink away to his boat with a flea in his ear. He had

Sekrang Dayaks were mixed up with the Malays of the Saribas and Batang Lupar,
who not only commanded and led them, but accompanied them in large numbers
seems to have been quite overlooked by both the Rajah's accusers and his supporters.
This in itself is a sufficient indication of the piratical nature of these expeditions. The
character of these Malays as pirates was at least beyond question, and to assert that
they went with these poor "harmless and timid" Dayaks to assist them in their
intertribal feuds would be a very wide stretch of imagination. We have shown that
the force routed on Beting Maru was led by Malays.</p>

With this chapter commences
the history
of the life of the
present Rajah, in itself
an epitome of
the history of the raj,
who in 1852, at the
age of twenty-three,
obtained two years'
leave of absence to try
his fortunes in Borneo
at the invitation of his
uncle the Rajah. He arrived at Kuching
on July 21, 1852, at the commencement
of a new era in the history of Sarawak.
Hitherto the raj extended only as far as
the Samarahan river, and within this little
state order had been established and peace
reigned. Without, it had been freed from
its enemies, the result being an increasing
trade which brought prosperity. But the Rajah could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>leave incomplete the work that he had undertaken and begun,
and these benefits had to be more fully extended to the neighbouring
districts, which were shortly to be added to the raj.
This could be done only by first reducing to order the
turbulent and restless Sea-Dayaks and Malays who inhabited
these districts. Sarawak, too, had now been left to fight its
own battles alone, and to surmount the additional troubles that
had been thrown across its path by the blind and weak policy
of the British Government that should have been its protector.
In the severe trials that followed, and which had to be faced
unhelped, the Rajah found that assistance which he so much
needed in the able and devoted support of his nephews, the
Tuan Besar, and, more notably, the Tuan Muda, for so the
present Rajah was entitled by the datus on his arrival.<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c011'><sup>[187]</sup></a> On
the expiration of his leave the Tuan Muda finally quitted the
Navy, and Sarawak became the scene of his life-work; he
was to become the Rajah's right-hand man, and, a few years
later, his trusted deputy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Charles Anthoni Johnson, the Tuan Muda, was the second
son of the Rev. Francis Charles Johnson, and was born on
June 3, 1829, at Berrow Vicarage, near Burnham, Somersetshire.
Educated in Crewkerne Grammar School for a few years
only, he was withdrawn at the age of a little over twelve, and
entered the Navy on January 18, 1842, as a volunteer of
the first class, under his uncle, Commander Willes Johnson of
the sloop <em>Wolverine</em>. He served on this ship until June,
1844, gaining two steps as midshipman in that year, when
he was transferred to the <em>Dido</em>, Captain the Hon. Henry
Keppel. He rejoined the <em>Wolverine</em>, serving under Commander
John Dalrymple Hay,<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c011'><sup>[188]</sup></a> until his transfer to the
<em>Mæander</em>, Captain the Hon. H. Keppel, in November, 1847,
as sub-lieutenant. He joined the <em>St. Vincent</em> in 1848, and
in June the next year was promoted to be senior mate of the
<em>Terrible</em>. He became lieutenant in 1852. He served
mostly on the China station; and the only active service he
saw was with Keppel's expedition and Sir Thomas Cochrane's
squadron in Borneo waters, as we have already recorded.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>The Tuan Muda was appointed to Lundu in January, 1853,
but he had not been there long before news arrived of the
death of Mr. Lee, the Resident at Lingga. The circumstances
were these: Ever since the severe lesson taught the Saribas
and Sekrangs in 1849, the piratical tribes had been divided into
two parties: one that was content to submit to the Government
of Sarawak, and abandon its former lawless practices,
and the other, consisting of the irreconcilables, the wild and
fiery bloods, who loved slaughter and rapine above everything,
and who could not be prevailed upon to beat their spears into
ploughshares. At their head stood a peculiarly daring and
turbulent Dayak chief called Rentap; and these had retreated
farther up the country to the head-waters of the Saribas.
There Rentap had established a strong stockade on Sadok,
a mountain ridge, up the Sungei (River) Lang, which was
regarded as an impregnable fastness, for access could not be
obtained to it by boat, on account of the rapids, and the
country that would have to be traversed by an expedition
was covered with dense jungles, and broken up by rugged
limestone chains of hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sekrang pirates could no longer shoot down to
the sea in their war prahus, for the forts of Sekrang and
Lingga commanded the river, consequently they exerted their
mischievous energies in attacking the peaceful Dayaks in their
districts, and they were especially irate against those of their
own tribe who had submitted to the white man's rule.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sekrang station under the able management of Mr.
Brereton had made great advances, and around the fort a
Malay town had sprung up, and there Chinese traders had
also established themselves. Mr. Brereton was ably supported
by two of the best and most capable Malay chiefs,
Pangiran Matali,<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c011'><sup>[189]</sup></a> a Bruni of rank, and Abang Aing,<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c011'><sup>[190]</sup></a> a Matu
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Melanau, who had long been settled in the Batang Lupar
with his father the Laksamana Menudin, and who had the
good fortune to have for a helpmate an upright and determined
woman, Dayang Kota; she was strong in council, and so
trustworthy that when Mr. Brereton and the chiefs were
away she was often left in charge of the fort.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fort at Lingga had been built in 1852 to protect
that river against marauding bands of Saribas, and had been
placed in charge of Mr. Alan Lee.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brereton and Lee were both men of independent means,
who had joined the Rajah to assist him in his great work,
and who never drew a penny from the Sarawak Government.
The former was hot and impetuous; both were men of noble
and generous natures.</p>

<p class='c000'>The position of Mr. Lee at Lingga was fairly safe. He
had been for a short time coadjutor with Brereton at
Sekrang; at Lingga he had plenty of Malays, and only
friendly Dayaks, the Balaus, about him. But Mr. Brereton
was in a more dangerous position, a single Englishman
among many thousand natives but partially reclaimed in
hardly five years, and all passionately attached to their
ancestral custom of head-hunting. It is true he had about
him a number of Malays, and on an emergency might call
in the assistance of those Dayaks of the Sekrang tribe who
professed allegiance, but many of these were waverers,
and on a few only could any reliance be placed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in 1853, reports reached Brereton that Rentap, at
the head of a war party, was on his way down the river to
attack his fort, and force an opening to the sea, so that
again he might pursue his piratical expeditions along the
coast; and Brereton sent a message to Lee at Lingga to
come to his assistance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The request was at once complied with, and, thinking
the case urgent, Lee hurried up the river with a scratch party,
insufficiently armed; but he left orders that a large force
was to follow with all possible speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>On reaching Sekrang, Lee learned that the force under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Rentap was approaching, and he strongly urged Brereton to
stand solely on the defensive, and not to attack the enemy
till his auxiliaries had arrived. Brereton, however, had built
a small stockade a few miles above Sekrang fort, and to this
he insisted on going, and was accompanied by Lee. On
the morning after reaching it, a few boats of the Sekrang
pirates were seen descending the river and approaching the
stockade. A gun was fired to signal them to desist, but
as this was disregarded, a charge of grape was poured into
them, throwing them apparently into confusion. Unfortunately,
the Malays in the fort were not to be restrained,
and Brereton was for at once dashing forth to attack the
enemy in the open on the river. Lee saw the injudiciousness
of such a proceeding. He was convinced that the two
prahus had been sent forward tentatively, and that the main
body of the enemy was concealed behind the point of land
farther up. He expostulated with Brereton, who taunted
him with a lack of courage, and then left the fort with his
Malays, and in their boats they ran in upon the main fleet
that was lurking in an upper reach, and which now swung
down, assisted by the ebb-tide, on Brereton's light prahus.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lee, nettled at the taunt, and seeing the peril in which
his friend and fellow-officer had so inconsiderately placed
himself, at once left the fort and hastened to his assistance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The small boats in which were the Malay garrison were
being swamped by the heavy bangkongs or war prahus of
the Sekrangs filled with armed men. Brereton's boat upset,
and with difficulty he reached the bank. Lee refused to
retreat, and calling out, "Save yourselves, I must stand,"
dashed on. His boat was boarded by the enemy; he
fought with desperation, but was overpowered and fell into
the water with his head nearly severed from his shoulders.
Meanwhile the force of the current had carried the fleet
under the guns of the stockade, and these opened fire upon
it, and compelled Rentap reluctantly to withdraw and
abandon his undertaking.<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c011'><sup>[191]</sup></a> He was followed up and
attacked by the Sekrang Dayak chief Gasing, who, acting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>on his own initiative, burnt twenty villages belonging to
Rentap's followers.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the news of this disaster reached Kuching, the
Tuan Muda was recalled from Lundu and ordered to replace
Lee at Lingga, and he arrived there in June, 1853. A
stronger fort was now built there, and the Malays living
at Banting were ordered to move down. He was succeeded
at Lundu by Mr. Charles Grant.<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c011'><sup>[192]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Lingga, which is just at the mouth of the river of that
name that flows into the Batang Lupar about sixteen miles
above its mouth, is seated on a mud bank; the land for
miles around is a dismal swamp, and is the most dreary
station in the State. It is, however, a healthy place, and
another redeeming point is the fine expanse of water which
forms the estuary of the Bantag Lupar, stretching from
Lingga, where it is three miles broad, straight to the mouth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dayak population of the Lingga river was then
about 5000, all Balaus, whom the Tuan Muda found to be
"braver than most Dayaks, and true-hearted." From the
first, they and the Seboyaus, a relative tribe, residing some
at Seboyau, below Lingga, but most at Lundu, had sided
with the Rajah against their direst foes, the Saribas; and
these pages record many great services rendered by them.
Besides these Dayaks there was a considerable number of
Malays, and the latter increased, for Lingga became to
them a place of refuge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indra Lila<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c011'><sup>[193]</sup></a> had been the chief here since his forced
departure from the Rejang (see footnote, p. <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>). He had
died a few months before, and had been succeeded by his
brother, Lila Pelawan,<a href='#f193' class='c011'><sup>[193]</sup></a> who died a centenarian in 1897.
There was another brother, Lila Wangsa,<a href='#f193' class='c011'><sup>[193]</sup></a> who had joined
the piratical Saribas Malays. Lila Pelawan was only the
nominal chief of the river, for it was really ruled by two
despotic old Malay ladies of rank, Dang Isa and Dang Ajar.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>These sisters claimed all the land as their inheritance, and
all the dwellers thereon as their slaves. Though they were
cruel and tyrannical in their methods, these masterful old
ladies had the redeeming point of being brave, and, attired
in men's clothing, with sword and spear, had often led the
men in resisting the attacks of the Saribas. Dang Ajar was
the most troublesome. It was she with whom the Kayan
chief, Akam Nipa, had fallen in love, and a pity it was that
his threat to abduct her was frustrated by the flight of the
Malays from Ngmah. Though professing a strong regard
for the Tuan Muda, whom they honoured by styling him
their son, they feared and hated him, for they saw that he
would soon deprive them of all power to do evil, and to prevent
this they even attempted to resort to poison. This was
the method by which they were commonly reputed to have
removed Indra Lila out of their way, as they would certainly
have done to his little son, so as to acquire his inheritance,
had not the Tuan Muda taken him under his protection. This
lad was Abang Abdul Gani, who became the Tuan Muda's
constant follower for years, and who afterwards gained for
himself the reputation of being one of the bravest and most
honest of the Government Malay officials.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they themselves foresaw, the power of these two old
ladies was soon brought to an end, and they retired into
seclusion to solace themselves with religion.</p>

<p class='c000'>In August, 1853, the Rajah went to Bruni, where he
found that his power and his popularity had not waned,
though discarded by the British Government, and discredited
by his own countrymen, and though he arrived in a small
merchant ship instead of in one of her Majesty's men-of-war.
He stayed some time in Bruni, and was warmly
received by the new Sultan, Abdul Mumin, for Omar Ali had
departed to answer for his sins, "and was fully and firmly
reinstated as their friend and adviser." Those districts outside
Sarawak, namely the Sadong, Batang Lupar, Saribas,
and Kalaka rivers and their tributaries, with a coast-line of
some seventy-five miles, in area about three times the size
of the raj, were now incorporated with it by a cession
granted by the Sultan, the Rajah agreeing to pay the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Sultan half of any surplus revenues that might accrue. We
may note here for convenience that this was altered
afterwards in 1861, when the territories as far as Kedurong
point were ceded, thereby giving the State a further coast-line
of 180 miles, and the rivers Rejang, Oya, Muka, Tatau,
and Bintulu. For this additional cession and that of 1853
a fixed yearly sum was to be paid to the Sultan as compensation
for loss of revenue; and these cessions, having
been made subsequent to the treaty of 1847, contain a
clause to the effect that none of the districts ceded by them
may be transferred by the Rajah or his successors to any
other government, company or persons without the sanction
of the British Government, but the Sultan's sanction is not required.
In the event of the cession money not being paid for
three consecutive years, the districts ceded would revert to
the Sultan; otherwise the sovereign and territorial rights
over these districts are absolutely invested in the Rajahs of
Sarawak, the Sultan having reserved no rights or power
whatever over them. The cessions subsequently obtained
by the present Rajah, which will be noted in their proper
places, were granted on the same terms.</p>

<p class='c000'>In December, the Rajah arrived at Lingga on his way
to Sekrang and farther up the river, with the object of
opening up communication with the turbulent members of
the Dayak tribes in the interior, under Rentap and Bulan.
These chiefs were men of very different character, and headed
native bodies of like diversity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rentap was an active, crafty, and determined man,
rootedly opposed to the interference of Europeans and the
putting down of piracy and head-hunting. On the other
hand, Bulan was the figure-head of a party that hesitated,
uncertain which direction affairs would take, and watching
to see which way the cat jumped. Bulan and his faction
would not engage in active hostility against the Rajah's
government, unless they saw that the tide of affairs was
setting strong against it. But also they would not profess
friendship, or lend help against the turbulent party.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tuan Muda attended the Rajah to Sekrang, and
several meetings were contrived with the leaders of the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>factions, but with no satisfactory results. In April, 1854,
owing to the representations of Mr. Brereton, an expedition
was organised against a chief called Apai<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c011'><sup>[194]</sup></a> Dendang at Dandi,
on the backbone or watershed between the Saribas and the
Sekrang river, a hotbed of mischief, whence several incursions
had been made into the pacified country, with the
usual results of rapine and murder.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tuan Muda brought up a contingent from Lingga,
and this, united with a force from Kuching, proceeded up
the Sekrang, passing troublesome and dangerous rapids, till
the point Lipat was reached, where the boats had to be left.
The backbone of hills was at some considerable distance,
and to reach it much thorny jungle had to be traversed.
After a day's march inland it was arranged that the
Europeans and the Sarawak Malay contingent should remain
behind, and that a fighting division of Dayaks should be
sent forward under their chiefs to attack Dandi, which consisted
of one long Dayak house. The plan adopted was
not the most judicious, and the result was disappointing.
We will describe what followed in the Tuan Muda's own
words.</p>

<p class='c013'>Late in the afternoon of the third day, when we anxiously
awaited the return of the advanced division, our outposts first
of all descried two or three small parties of Dayaks evidently of our
force, wending their way slowly over hill and dale. On their
nearer approach, we plainly saw wounded men carried by them.
Whispers spread—gradually and quietly at first, but they soon
became more distinct—that our party had failed. In the evening
the chiefs arrived and came forward to report progress, looking
haggard, thin, and exhausted. The story was as follows—they had
walked at a fast pace the whole of the first day over the steepest
hills, sometimes without any path, and the guides at a nonplus for
the proper direction; from morning till night they scarcely halted,
under a scorching sun; and parched with thirst without any hope
of water. At night, by moonlight, they pushed on again, until they
nearly fell from exhaustion, when they slept in any position with
their arms on. About 3 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> they again advanced, and, at the
opening of dawn, the most active Dayaks, reaching the enemy's
house, advanced upon it without order, and as the leaders were
mounting the ladder, they were struck off one after another by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>hundreds of men inside, dressed in fighting costumes, and headed
by the whole of the Saribas tribe, men heretofore on every occasion
on land, victorious. Our poor leaders had to retire to guard their
wounded and dying, while the enemy were yelling, cheering, and
beating gongs; and even their women, dressed in their best clothes,
were clapping their hands, and urging their sweethearts to the
encounter.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the sun rose, some of the strongest of the Malay force came
up within shot, and took up quarters behind trees and opened fire
upon the house. This stopped the cheering within, but in no way
daunted the enemy. About an hour after, our elderly chiefs came
up, viewed the house of the enemy, sat down on the hillside in a
sheltered position, and were so exhausted that children might have
hacked their heads off. They stopped all advance of their party,
and while the oldest chiefs were suffering severely from fatigue, a
palaver was opened, the result being that some of the enemy came
down, mixed with our people, then partook of sirih and betel-nut in
a friendly manner, and promised to show our party the nearest
way back, and provide them with provisions for their journey. On
their part they engaged to be answerable for the payment of a
"death fine" for the men they had killed some months previously.</p>

<p class='c000'>News that a large expedition had been organised against
Dandi had reached Apai Dendang before the departure of
the force from Sekrang, and he had summoned to his
assistance all the bravest men of the Saribas tribe, and the
principal leaders of every head-hunting expedition for some
time past; nevertheless he was unwilling to drive matters
to an extremity, having a wholesome dread of the white
men. This rendered him ready to treat and buy off the
expedition with a promise of indemnity for murders recently
committed.</p>

<p class='c000'>A fatal want of discretion had been shown in the whole
affair, no trustworthy guides had been engaged, no inquiry
made as to whether the Saribas were coming up to the
succour of Apai Dendang, no English leaders were sent forward
with the rabble of assailants, and that rabble had
attacked in straggling detachments, when exhausted with
hard marching and with thirst.</p>

<p class='c013'>We returned home with feelings that can be better imagined
than described. The Dayaks said that the omens had been bad
from the outset; the Malays said if they had only been there,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>the result would have been different; and the Europeans said—nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>In August, 1854, the Rajah arrived at Lingga with a
large force which had been collected at Kuching, and proceeded
to Sekrang, taking with him the Tuan Muda;
The Tuan Besar, together with other European officers, who
had come with the Rajah, also lent their aid. The object
was to attack Rentap in his fastness in Sungei Lang. The
whole force numbered 7000 Malays and Dayaks. To prevent
the Saribas from sending their fighting men to the
assistance of Rentap, the Datu Temanggong was despatched
with a flotilla up that river to menace their villages and to
hold the Saribas warriors in check. Mr. Steele<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c011'><sup>[195]</sup></a> was to
lead another party up the Kanowit to threaten the Dayaks
of that river and its branches the Kajulau and Entabai,
with a rear attack should they cross over to the Saribas.
Mr. Steele had been thrice attacked at Kanowit fort, but
now he could muster fifteen hundred men and take the
offensive, and, though possibly he would have to do no fighting,
his force would deter the Kajulaus from sending aid to
Rentap. The expedition was thoroughly well thought out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah, with the main body, leaving the Sekrang
fort, ascended the river for about thirty miles to a place
called Entaban. The heavy prahus were brought thus far
with great difficulty, owing to the rapids, and beyond that
point it was impossible to proceed in them. Accordingly
a stockade was erected, and the Tuan Besar was placed in
command of the expedition by land to Sungei Lang, with his
brother, the Tuan Muda, Mr. Crookshank, Mr. Brereton, and
four other English officers to assist. The Rajah's health
would not admit of his undertaking the arduous march. He
remained behind with a strong force to protect the flotilla.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the heavy war boats could ascend no farther,
it was possible for part of the force to continue the ascent
of the river in light boats, and this was done, the Europeans
and Malays marching.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>To continue the narrative from the Tuan Muda's
description:—</p>

<p class='c013'>We had Dayak guides, and could not have proceeded without
them. Our land force consisted mostly of Malays, and numbered
about 500 men—the Sekrang Dayaks were in their boats. About
4 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> we halted on the brink of the river and prepared to spend
the night with a stockade around. This was in the enemy's country,
although there were many people living near who were neither the
one thing nor the other. The following morning we proceeded again
in the same order, but before mid-day many of our party were quite
exhausted, and there was really no road to follow but the muddy
banks of the river, so we halted, and after our mid-day meal it was
decided that we were all to crowd in with the floating force. And
thus we pushed on, but in a most comfortless condition with regard
to space. We spent the night at Tabbat, and fortified ourselves
here also. My subsequent experience of the localities has proved
that we should never have reached our destination on foot, keeping
company with the boats. On the fourth day we spied the enemy's
position, situated on a hill cleared of all old jungle and showing
recent preparations of defence around their dwellings. Our heavy
armament consisted of 4- and 3-pounder guns and rocket tubes.</p>

<p class='c013'>The enemy showed no opposition outside, and after marching
about four miles, we arrived at a hill in their vicinity. It was a fiery
hot morning without a cloud, and the hills, though low, were
very precipitous. The Europeans kept near the guns, to assist in
their progress up the steeps, and when we were mounting the last
rising ground on which the enemy was fortified, we found some of
the leaders of our force had foolishly advanced too near, and a few
had been killed and wounded, and were now being carried to the
rear. The enemy had two long houses on the ridge of a hill,
surrounded by steep ground excepting at the end. Here high stakes
were driven into the earth, and around all a firm and thick stockade.
The 4-pounder gun was mounted after considerable delay, and,
when the rocket tube was in place, we opened fire on one end,
while the 3-pounder played away on the other. The enemy
answered our fire pretty briskly with their lelahs.<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c011'><sup>[196]</sup></a> We could see
the men rushing to and fro covered with their shields, also parties
dancing to the music of the gongs. Some of their voices we heard
distinctly, saying they would never succumb to the tight-breeched
men (white men) or to any other strangers. Mr. Crookshank (at
considerable risk) took charge of the rockets, which were of ancient
make, and a few that were fired entered the fort and did great
execution, but the majority whizzed round and round and sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>lodged in the ground among our own party; we were all more
afraid of these missiles than anything the enemy could produce.
Early in the afternoon there was a commotion among the enemy,
and we could discern women and children leaving on the opposite
side of the hill, but the men stood fast and kept their posts.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our old Penglima<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c011'><sup>[197]</sup></a> was biding his time, for he yet knew that
he might lead, but others would not follow. He worked steadily
and quietly, amid many jeers from some of our own native party,
who asked why the warrior did not make an advance: his reply
between his teeth was—"Your words are more than your deeds."
As the sun drew near to the horizon, the Penglima moved up to the
enemy's stockade, silently opened the palisade, and, after a moment's
peep, jumped in, followed by others, who gave a loud cheer and
drew their swords. The enemy, finding a lodgment had been
made inside, immediately took to their heels and fled down the hill.
We followed in close to the leaders; the entrance was so narrow
that many received contusions when passing through. About fifty
or sixty of the enemy were tearing away over the open ground, covering
their bodies with their shields.</p>

<p class='c000'>These were followed by all the defenders of the stockade,
who rolled down the side of the hill, a living wave, bearing
away with them their chief Rentap, who had been wounded.
The stockade was taken, and within its defences the victors
passed the night, whilst the enemy fled precipitately to a
second and still stronger fastness on the summit of the
mountain Sadok, which loomed in the distance. One of the
most curious and significant features of the conflict was that,
whilst it was in progress, the hills and every commanding
position around were crowded with Dayaks, the adherents
of Bulan, as well as others, who watched it with lively
interest, taking no part on one side or the other, but waiting
to see to which side the scale would incline. Had the attacking
force met with discomfiture, these men would have fallen
on it and harassed the party as it retreated.</p>

<p class='c000'>If, after the defeat of Rentap and the capture of the
stockade in the Lang, they did not tender allegiance to the
Government, it was because the expedition retired immediately
after having achieved its first success, and, therefore, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>gave the waverers no permanent assurance of protection
against Rentap's resentment.</p>

<p class='c000'>To have crushed Rentap, it would have been necessary
to have pursued him to his second stronghold at Sadok, but
this was not done. Captain Brooke in command doubtless
saw the expediency of following up a routed foe, but Dayak
warriors are wont to rest content with a single victory, and,
that gained, to become uncontrollably impatient to return
home; besides, the force was in too disturbed a state to
undertake any organised attack; accordingly, after making
a circuit of devastation, it returned.</p>

<p class='c000'>The result was that Rentap continued to give trouble
for seven years.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brereton died of dysentery, brought on by exposure,
shortly after this expedition, and the Tuan Muda was placed
in charge of the Batang Lupar in October, 1854. The
district was in a very disturbed state, and to establish order
by putting an end to intertribal feuds and promiscuous head-hunting
required an unceasing watch being kept on all, and
necessitated many punitive expeditions being made. The
Tuan Muda had but a handful of fortmen, for there was no
money to spend; not more than £30 per mensem being
allowed even so late as 1860 for the upkeep of the district,
and it must have been less then. Little support could be
expected from the capital. On the Kajulau expedition the
Tuan Muda could muster no more than 100 antiquated
muskets and a few rifles, which included twelve flint and six
percussion muskets, all that could be spared from Kuching.
There was much to be done, but there was deficiency of
means to do the work. The Rajah's advice to him was:
"to encourage the good, intimidate the bad, and confirm the
wavering." The difficulties were so many, and the means at
hand so limited, that the position would have been hopeless
except to a man of great tact, patience, daring, and untiring
activity, able to bear all the responsibility, all the anxiety,
and all the work upon his own shoulders. It must be borne
in mind that Kuching was some 125 miles away, that those
were the days when there were no steamers, and that during
the north-east monsoon navigation was dangerous to boats.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>How the Tuan Muda succeeded will be told in this record
of his career; here it will be sufficient to say, quoting the
late Rajah, "that he was the right man in the right place,
and that we are all children in Dayak management compared
to him."</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1856, the Tuan Muda writes (in <cite>Ten Years in
Sarawak</cite>):—</p>

<p class='c013'>We are almost daily having alarms in one place or another;
sometimes on water and sometimes on land. And upon one side
of the whole length of the river, the inhabitants dare not farm or
live, fearing attacks from the interior of Sekrang and Saribas. Small
parties make their foraging excursions and run away with a head
here and there, and are far distant before we can follow them up.</p>

<p class='c000'>Intertribal feuds, which had been more or less dropped in
the common cause of piracy—and the plethora of heads it
afforded—had now broken out again, and were growing in
intensity. Besides these troubles in the Batang Lupar and
Saribas, the Dayaks of the Rejang living on the Serikei and
Kajulau rivers were giving considerable trouble. These
Dayaks had moved over from the Sekrang and Saribas and
were hand-in-glove with Rentap's rebels. They were open
and declared enemies of the Government. The Kajulau was
considered to be the centre of the enemy's country, and also
to be inaccessible to attack. Confident in their impunity,
they were becoming a terror to the peaceable inhabitants
of the Rejang delta, so the Tuan Muda determined to attack
them, and organised an expedition—the first to act independently
of Kuching assistance, except for the loan of
the dozen old muskets above mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>On June 6, 1856, the force, comprising a few Malays,
and some 3000 Dayaks, started. To take the enemy by
surprise the Tuan Muda decided to go up the Kalaka and
march overland. Though the Malays of this river had
suffered severely at the hands of the Kajulaus, they at first
refused to accompany the expedition, regarding the difficulties
as insuperable, and the danger as overwhelming.
The result was that half the Malay force the Tuan Muda had
brought with him were intimidated, and began to cry off;
but Abang Aing restored their confidence, and shamed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Kalakas into accompanying the expedition. On the 14th,
after having encountered great difficulties in passing the
rapids, the force reached the Budu stream, and here the boats
were left, but as there were enemies ahead and enemies to
the right (the Saribas) a strong stockade was erected and
garrisoned, to serve as a base and to guard the rear. Near
this base were two long Dayak houses, and in one of them
was staying a notorious Saribas Dayak chief named Saji.
As the people were not declared enemies, though very doubtful
friends, Saji could not be touched, but he remained a danger
to be reckoned with, and against whom precautions had
to be taken, for as soon as the expedition started overland
he would be able to follow it with hundreds of men. But
Saji was cautious. He preferred to wait to make his attack
till the return of the expedition, when it would be easier to
surprise, for, if not defeated, it would probably be disorganised.
The march commenced on the 16th. The bala formed in
three columns with the Malays in the centre, and at evening
the tawaks (gongs) of the enemy could be heard in the distance
sounding the alarm. But it was not until the 18th, after a
tedious march over hilly land, that the verge of the enemy's
country was reached. At 3 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> a sharp encounter took
place, and the enemy were driven off, leaving a few dead on
the field, and several long houses that had been abandoned in
haste were entered and plundered. One of these houses the
Tuan Muda occupied; and, finding that the enemy, taken by
surprise, attempted no attack and offered no organised resistance,
the force was divided up and despatched in different
directions under their own leaders to burn and destroy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here an episode occurred which nearly proved
disastrous. On the afternoon of the 19th, an attack was
expected, and the house occupied by the Tuan Muda was
greatly crowded with warriors to defend it. At 7 o'clock
it was observed that the posts supporting the house were
sloping considerably, and it was found that this had been
caused by the Dayaks having stowed away in it overmuch
of their heavy plunder, such as brass guns, jars, and
gongs, and hundreds had gone up into the house, though
by custom they ought to have remained without on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>ground. A collapse would have meant the loss of many
lives, and would have been taken advantage of by the
watchful enemy. Upon the insistence of Abang Aing, the
Tuan Muda left the house, and the Malays were directed to
turn the Dayaks out instantly. But this was by no means
easy to be done; indeed the Dayaks resisted being made to
evacuate the house and leave their plunder there.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst the Tuan Muda was sitting out in the moonlight,
a sudden din and the sounds of strife arose from the house.
Men came flying down the ladder, and others hurried up it.
Then three Balau Dayak chiefs begged the Tuan Muda to go
up immediately. Against the protests of Abang Aing, with
sword and gun in hand, he ascended, and found Dayaks and
Malays in a heated and dangerous condition, opposed to
one another with drawn swords in their hands. Planting
himself between the antagonists, the Tuan Muda ordered
silence, and cocking his double-barrelled gun and placing the
muzzle within two inches of the leading Dayak's head, he
ordered him to leave the house. Amidst a dead silence the
chief went, followed by the Tuan Muda, the Dayaks edging
away and making a path for them along the verandah to the
ladder. Thus ended the disturbance, and by the morrow
it was forgotten. It was arrested just in time to prevent a
desperate encounter between the Malays and Dayaks, which
would have been taken up by the other Dayak factions—for
in the bala were Dayaks of different tribes, only held
together by the controlling influence of their white chief—and
there would have been fighting among themselves. The
enemy, taking advantage of this, would have fallen upon
and routed them, and the survivors flying to regain the
boats would have been cut off by Saji and his Saribas.
The power of the Government among the Sea-Dayaks
would have been broken completely, and it would have taken
many years to recover it, a calamity which was averted by
the bold and prompt action of the Tuan Muda, and his
personal power over Malays and Dayaks alike.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 20th, the attacking parties returned after having
destroyed twenty-five villages, and having secured an
immense amount of plunder. There were but few killed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>on either side; the enemy had given way, cowed, and
had offered but little resistance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus was a severe lesson administered to the Sea-Dayaks,
which they never forgot, and it showed them that they could
and would be treated even as they had so long treated
others with impunity.</p>

<p class='c013'>"There is no way," wrote the Tuan Muda, "but burning them
out of house and home—dreadful as this may appear. The women
too must suffer, for they are the principal inciters of these bloody
exploits.<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c011'><sup>[198]</sup></a> An attack on a Dayak force, the destruction of the whole
of it, with the lives of the men, is no permanent advancement
towards cessation of head-taking. But the burning down of a village,
loss of goods, old relics, such as heads, arms, and jars,<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c011'><sup>[199]</sup></a> and putting
the inhabitants, male and female, to excessive inconvenience—all
this fills them with fear and makes them think of the consequences
of taking the heads of strangers. These inland abodes have been
and are everlasting fastnesses in their imagination. Besides, they
always express very freely their opinion of white men; 'they are
powerful, having arms and ships at sea, but it is only we Dayaks
who can walk and fight on land and clamber steep mountains.'"</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 21st, the march home was commenced, the
leaders in the advance becoming now the rearmost. These
were the most trusted and bravest chiefs; conspicuous among
them was Pangiran Matali. Their instructions were positive—to
keep a sharp look-out for the enemy, and to permit no
one to lag behind. Most of the Dayaks were heavily laden
with plunder, and the enemy was hovering about their track
in the hope of cutting off the stragglers.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the return to the stockade:</p>

<p class='c013'>A delicious bathe, and some wine and water were the first things
to have. Then a lounge in the boat in thin clothing, with that
exhilarating feeling of lightness which one experiences after a
Turkish bath. During my enjoyment in the satisfaction that our
trials were well-nigh over, a rush was heard with tumultuous yells,
and armed people were dashing back over the path by which we had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>come. I soon learnt that "Iron Anchor"<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c011'><sup>[200]</sup></a> and Pangiran Matali had
been attacked in the rear, and within five minutes two Dayaks
rushed to my boat carrying a head yet gory and dripping. The
yells and cheers were deafening, and it was some time before I could
get the particulars of what had happened. After the noise had
somewhat subsided "Iron Anchor" and the Pangiran came to me
and told me that as they were marching and bringing up the rear,
about three miles off, a party of Dayaks came down the hill close to
them. The Pangiran hailed and asked them who they were; the
answer was, "We are of one bala (force)." Our party hailed again
and then fired. Two of the strangers fell dead, the others took to
flight. On Sandom<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c011'><sup>[201]</sup></a> following them up, he saw Saji with a large
party fully armed for the purpose of making an onslaught on our
rear. The Pangiran fortunately could recognize the Dayak tribes,
and well knew their craft and different costumes. Our party escaped
unhurt, and Saji, who had, I subsequently was told, vaunted that he
would get forty of our heads, mine amongst the number, ran for his
life, leaving two dead behind him.</p>

<p class='c000'>In February, 1857, the Tuan Muda received the startling
news that the Chinese had risen and fallen upon Kuching.
He was told that the Rajah had been killed, along with Mr.
Crookshank and many other Europeans. Before ten minutes
had passed, Sekrang fort was crowded with armed men
breathing vengeance, and within an hour, boats had been
launched and the Tuan Muda with Abang Aing had started.
Below Lingga next morning they met the vessel bearing the
English refugees—the Bishop, his family, and others, and
from them the Tuan Muda learnt the glad tidings of the
Rajah's safety. Knowing that his force would be sufficient
to crush the rebels and re-establish the Rajah's rule, he
pushed on with his mind now more at ease. He arrived
at Kuching to find the town in ruins, but the Rajah in
charge again on board the Borneo Company's steamer <cite>Sir
James Brooke</cite>. As a full account of the insurrection and of
the subsequent events will be found in the following chapter,
we will now return to the subject of this one to preserve
a continuous record of the events that led to the downfall
of Rentap.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>On the afternoon of the Tuan Muda's return from
Kuching, after an arduous time driving the Chinese rebels
over the border, he received information that the notorious
Saji was out with a head-hunting party along the coast.
Prompt action was necessary, and the Tuan Muda by sunset
had started in his war-boat, leaving Abang Aing and the
Malays to follow. Whilst waiting inside the mouth of the
Ludam, a little stream half-way between the mouths of the
Batang Lupar and Saribas, for his Malay and Dayak
contingents, a boat dashed past towards the Saribas. This
the Tuan Muda subsequently learnt was Saji, who off Lingga
had fallen in with a small boat containing a man, his wife,
and their daughter. Feigning friendliness Saji approached,
and when near enough attacked the little party. The man
escaped by taking to the water, his wife was cut down and
her head taken, and the girl was captured. When passing
the Ludam Saji had noticed the Tuan Muda's boat-flag over
the bank, the tide being high, and he sat with his drawn
sword across the girl's throat prepared to take her life
immediately if she attempted to call out, or should any
notice be taken of them. On being joined by the Malays and
the Balau Dayaks the coast was patrolled, and the Saribas was
searched for some way up, but the head-hunters had retired.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sadok, Rentap's stronghold, was regarded by the Dayaks
as impregnable. Since the destruction of the stockaded
village at Sungei Lang, he had strengthened his position there.
In legend and song the Dayaks represented this place as a
mountain so inaccessible, and so protected by magic, that no
enemy would ever dare to assail it. Rentap had gathered
about him all the disaffected Sekrang Dayaks and some of
the Saribas of the interior, who offered him aid so long as
he occupied this eyrie, which stood as an unapproachable
nucleus and basis far removed from danger, and to which
they might all retire in case of need from the rule of the
white man, that thwarted their head-hunting and marauding
propensities. Rentap was entitled the Inland Rajah, and
was the centre of all opposition to the rule of the Rajah of
Sarawak. His fortification was near 5000 feet above the
sea, with precipitous approaches on almost every side.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>The Tuan Muda had obtained permission to undertake
another expedition against this stronghold. His intention
was to pass over the mountain, lay waste the country at the
head of the Saribas, and, after so cutting off Rentap's supplies
and reinforcements, to attempt the chief's position on his
return.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Saribas, which was still a hornet's nest, affairs
were coming to a head. The Dayaks were about to retire
into the interior with the Datu Patinggi of Saribas, who,
together with the Laksamana, was encouraging the Dayaks
to continue in their evil courses. But for the Malays, and
even amongst them there were many inclined to a life of
peace, though these were in a minority, the Dayaks of the
lower Saribas would have submitted to the Government, and
amongst the latter the Rajah could now count many adherents;
but the power of the evilly disposed Malay chiefs, headed by
the Patinggi, and of the Dayak chiefs, headed by Rentap,
was dominant in the Saribas. To check them the Rajah
took a large force to that river, and went at the time that
the Tuan Muda was starting on his expedition, so as to disguise
the object of the latter's preparations, by leading the
people to suppose that his intention was to support the
Rajah; and to be at hand to attack the Saribas Dayaks
in rear should they muster in force to assist Rentap.
The Tuan Besar at the same time went to the Rejang,
to hold the Dayaks of that river in check.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tuan Muda took no Europeans with him, fearing
that the fatigue of the difficult overland march might knock
them up, and cause them to become encumbrances; his
force consisted of 3500 Dayaks, and 500 Malays, all willing
volunteers, though many conceived the task to be beyond
their powers; but where he went they were ready to follow,
confident that under his direction they would be well led.</p>

<p class='c000'>The expedition started on June 2, 1857, a little over
three months after the Chinese insurrection, and left Sekrang
in drizzling rain; throughout it encountered miserable
weather, which damped the ardour of the force. The
Malays especially cannot endure wet, a few days' exposure
brings on fever and ague, and the cold, to which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Dayaks would be exposed on the mountain, was likely to so
numb them as to render them useless.</p>

<p class='c000'>Old Sandom was once more the guide. He had his
personal wrong to avenge, as we have already stated. "Iron
Anchor" and Pangiran Matali were again the leaders.</p>

<p class='c000'>On June 5, the boats were drawn up at Sungei
Antu, on a little island of rubble and brushwood, upon
which a stockade was erected, and where the flotilla was
to be left. Forty men, well armed, were deputed to
take charge of the boats and baggage in this extemporised
fort, whilst the rest moved overland in the direction of
the mountain. On the 7th of June, a height, the bold
ridge on which the enemy had established himself,
came in sight, with a succession of hills intervening like a
chopping sea turned to rock. It was resolved to push on
that day to Rapu, the northern termination of the mountain,
and there to establish a stockade from which parties might
descend and devastate the country of the hostile Saribas, on
which Rentap had to depend for supplies. But it was not
found possible to do in one day what was determined. The
mountain was indeed reached, but ascended only by some of
the advance party of Dayaks, who could not be restrained,
and who scrambled up the side to the summit of the hogs-back,
to be driven back with great loss, not of lives only, but
of confidence and courage as well. The bulk of the force
was constrained to bivouac in rain and cold on the mountain
flank.</p>

<p class='c013'>The last hundred yards were almost perpendicular, and when
mounting I had to pull myself up with one hand by the stunted
trees; added to this, there was a declivity of thousands of feet on
each side. In ascending this part not more than twenty men
were with me. My best fort-man was wounded by a spear, and to
assist him many of the others had left me. And now I must give
credit to the Lingga people, for they were close at hand. I was
within about five yards of the enemy, who were pitching spears from
behind some wood on the brow of the hill, while we were underneath,
and the spears went flying over my head and struck some of
our party in the rear. Here I stood propped up against a tree, and
poured thirty rounds from my smooth bore as fast as I could load.
After this I tried to ascend, but the Linggas literally collared me.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>The enemy were quieted, so here we sat on the side of this hill, at
an angle of 80°, the whole night. A few cross sticks were placed
for me to sit on. One man held a shield at my back.</p>

<p class='c000'>When morning broke the Tuan Muda and his followers
succeeded in reaching the summit of the mountain, and
could look along the brow to the opposite end, where stood
the stronghold of the redoubtable Rentap, to which the
enemy had retired. Several of the attacking force had been
killed or wounded on the previous day, and over a hundred
had rolled down the steep sides, and in so doing lost arms
and ammunition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The "Iron Anchor" maintained his position manfully,
and well merited his name.</p>

<p class='c000'>On that day, June 8, the force proceeded to stockade
the position gained at the Rapu end of the mountain, confronting
that occupied by the fortress of Rentap, which was
not above four hundred yards off. This latter was a formidable
stockade of iron-wood, impervious to rifle shots, with
precipices to the right and left; and the stockade was commanded
by the high-placed houses inside, from which
volleys could be poured on an attacking army, that must
advance in a narrow file along the backbone of rock leading
to it. Indeed, to assail the fort from the northern extremity
seemed doomed to failure, the few men leading could
be picked off and would roll down the declivities on
this side or that, or encumber the path by which those
behind were pressing on, and expose them also to be shot
down, for the enemy possessed muskets, cannon, and also
a swivel captured when Lee was killed.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the eight days they remained on the hill it rained
incessantly, and the force suffered severely from cold, finding
little shelter in their leaking huts, the earth floors of which
were soon converted into pools of mire. On the 9th, thinking
that the force in advancing towards Rentap's fortification,
had left its rear unguarded, a body of the enemy that had
marched to Rentap's assistance made an attack on the
camp, but they soon found out their mistake, and were easily
beaten off. The next day a division of Dayaks and Malays
proceeded against Rentap's allies, whom they drove back,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>and whose houses they plundered and burnt. On the
following days other parties were sent out to do the enemy
as much harm as possible, and to deter them from joining
Rentap's party in the stockade, or harassing the main
assailing force. In the meantime the Tuan Muda had
attempted to get his men to storm the fortress at night,
promising to lead the way himself; but they would not face
the risk, though later on they consented to attack the place
in force. Three days were spent in constructing portable
screens of laths and bamboos, under the cover of which
parties could progress along the dangerous ridge and make
an attempt to set fire to the stockade. At mid-day on the
15th the attack commenced.</p>

<p class='c013'>I took up my position with a rifle, and watched for movements
among the enemy, but the active work I left to Aing, who, drawn
sword in hand, superintended with much activity. The sounds
were deafening, and the fellows carried the wood and materials
under the fire of Rentap's guns. At 4 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> my party had attained
to within six or seven yards from the outer fort, and the scene was
truly exciting. Our enemies evidently were not numerous. They
threw stones from the inside which fell on the heads of our fellows,
and used muskets, together with a swivel. At half-past five our
leader, crouching under the moving stockade, called for fire, and the
wood collected was in considerable quantities. At this juncture
Aing fell, wounded by a musket shot. Then evening set in, and
we were obliged to return to our quarters. The enemy yelled in
triumph at our departure.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wood collected had been so saturated with rain that it
refused to kindle.</p>

<p class='c013'>As I lay down to rest at night, I gave up all thought of gaining
Rentap's fortress, but resolved to see what could be done elsewhere.
When I rose the last morning, the enemy was yelling, and
my first desire was to get about a hundred of the strongest young
fellows together, command myself, and proceed to Atui, where
there were three long houses of enemies, about six hours' walk distant.
This I promised to do in three days, when I would return
here and march back with the whole force. I could obtain no
volunteers; some said they were sick, others out of provisions, and
I was obliged to bow to circumstances, and at eight o'clock our
party began to descend the mountain.</p>
<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>The retreat was conducted without serious molestation
by the enemy, but, on reaching Antu, it was found that
owing to the rain a freshet had come down, the river rising
twelve feet, and had swept the stockade away and carried
off over seventy of the boats. The discouragement was
great, and the return down the river was not effected without
some annoyance from the enemy, who hid in the jungle and
fired on the party as, in overcrowded boats, it descended the
Sekrang. None were thus killed, but some were drowned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus ended the first expedition against Sadok. It had
done something, though no serious damage, but it exalted the
confidence of Rentap in the impregnability of his stronghold.
Practically it had been a failure, and so it was felt to be
among Malays and Dayaks generally. The unrest in the
country became more accentuated, and the daring of the
Saribas increased.</p>

<p class='c000'>In April, 1858, the Tuan Muda says:</p>

<p class='c013'>I had for many months been tormented by the affairs in Saribas,
which had been for generations the hotbed of head-hunters and
piracy in every shape. The people were becoming more audacious,
and I found it had been to no purpose holding communication with
even the Malays, who, a few days ago, refused to receive a letter,
and declared they intended shortly to ascend the river and live with
the Dayaks, and eat pork as they did. It was evident that a crisis
was approaching which would require resolute action, or our <em>prestige</em>
would be injured in this quarter. This we could by no means
afford to lose, as stoppage of all trade and communication on the
coast would inevitably ensue.</p>

<p class='c000'>A fleet of forty Saribas pirates' vessels was known to be
ready to descend the river for a foray on the coast under Saji
and another notorious Dayak chief, Lintong;<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c011'><sup>[202]</sup></a> and was
only detained till the boat of the former was ready at Paku,
forty miles from the mouth. No time was to be lost to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>prevent this force from reaching the sea, and the Tuan
Muda sent to Kuching for aid. Meantime he manned
his big boat with sixty men, and a 3-pounder was placed in
her bows. Thus equipped, he sped to Lingga, where he
fortunately found the small gunboat schooner, the <em>Jolly
Bachelor</em>, commanded by John Channon.<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c011'><sup>[203]</sup></a> He now started
up the Saribas river with a picked crew, and with numerous
native boats following. The flotilla advanced as far as the
mouth of the Padi river, on which was the village of Saji.
Here they anchored, and a 6-pounder gun was pointed up
the Saribas in case the enemy's forty war-boats should come
down. Thence a party was detailed inland to attack Saji
and his pestilent horde. This was done. The enemy was
driven back with loss, and their houses destroyed. A more
dreaded enemy than the Saribas now assailed the expedition,
and that was cholera. In consternation the force began to
break up and return home. The Tuan Muda resolved on
constructing a fort and establishing a government on the
river, and for that purpose retired down to Betong, a site
he had selected as most suitable for a station.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst engaged in collecting materials for the fort, the
reinforcements from Kuching arrived under the charge
of young Mr. J. B. Cruickshank,<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c011'><sup>[204]</sup></a> but too late to be of any
use. The cholera prevented any further action being taken;
but the time was usefully spent in completing the fort.
Leaving Cruickshank in charge, the Tuan Muda returned to
Sekrang, and while there heard that the Saribas were again
in motion for a coast raid, their destination being unknown.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was led by the redoubtable Linggir again. The Tuan
Muda at once sent orders for the Balau Dayaks to muster
and intercept the force. The order was promptly carried
out, and Linggir's bala was defeated with a loss of fourteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>men, Linggir himself having another very narrow escape.
But other parties were out, and the Tuan Muda himself set
forth for the Saribas to intercept some of these marauders.
Here he was joined by Mr. Watson<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c011'><sup>[205]</sup></a> on his way to take
charge of the new fort—a welcome addition for the
reinforcement of that establishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tuan Muda warned the Malay villagers at the mouth
of the Saribas, who were restless and desirous of encouraging
the pirates, that they would be held responsible should any
pirate boats be suffered to pass, and then returned to Sekrang
to hasten preparations for an ascent of the Saribas river
with a large body of men to chastise the turbulent natives
who, led by Saji, had attacked Betong fort on July 14, 1858,
and to press on and again try conclusions with Rentap.</p>

<p class='c000'>After some delay the Kuching force started, and reached
the rendezvous at the mouth of the Saribas river, but the
Tuan Muda had been delayed, waiting for his Dayaks, and it
proceeded to Betong. The leading division was a force from
Kuching under the Tuan Besar, who commanded this expedition.
It passed on several days before the Tuan Muda
with the main force arrived at Betong fort, but was soon
overtaken. The river was found to have been purposely
obstructed. Large trees standing low on the banks had
been felled so as to fall across, and, where narrow, block the
stream. And this had been done for several miles. They
were not formed into a boom, but left to lie where they fell.
This is a favourite plan of the Dayaks for hindering the
progress of an enemy up stream. Moreover, by cutting
trees inclining to the river nearly through to the breaking
point, and then sustaining them by means of rattans, they
can in a moment sever these strings and let the trees fall
on and crush the leading boats. Some thirty-five years ago,
a Dutch gunboat whilst steaming up the Kapuas river was
sunk in this manner, and her crew slaughtered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding the obstructions, the flotilla advanced,
and the enemy retired up stream. During five days' hard
rowing, it progressed till it reached Pengirit, just below the
Langit river, and here the vanguard fell in with the enemy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>under Saji. Saji gallantly attacked, and met the fate
he so richly deserved. "Saji's name and acts had been in
my ears for years past," wrote the Tuan Muda. "Many a
bloody deed had been perpetrated, and he always had
boasted that the White Men's powder and shot would take
no effect on his body." So fell one of the most cruel and
treacherous head-hunters of those days.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the mouth of the Langit river a stockade was
erected. Here on a clear night the moon was eclipsed.
The Tuan Muda had seen by his almanack that this would
occur, and had announced to the host that it would take
place. If this had not been done a panic would have
ensued, and the natives would have insisted on leaving; but
as it was, they conceived that the phenomenon had been
ordered by the white chief, to strike terror into the hearts of
their foes, as also to encourage them; they were accordingly
in good heart to advance.</p>

<p class='c000'>They pushed on readily enough to Nanga Tiga,<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c011'><sup>[206]</sup></a> the
junction of three rivers, one flowing from Sadok, one from
the watershed where rises the Kanowit river, and the third
the main Saribas. Here the boats were to be left, and a
stout stockade was erected. Thence preparations were
made to advance up-country towards the Rejang. The
Tuan Muda, with whom went Cruickshank, was in command
and led the van. Messrs. Steele and Fox<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c011'><sup>[207]</sup></a> were to take
charge of the rear division. The whole party comprised
200 Malays and 2000 Dayaks.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Nanga Tiga this party made for the head-waters
of the Kajulau, to lay waste the territory of the troublesome
natives there. It may seem, and it does seem at first sight,
and to such as are not acquainted with native warfare, a
barbarous process to burn villages and destroy the padi-fields
with the crops on which the natives subsist. But, as already
said, it is the only way in which these savages can be brought
to submission. The women indeed suffer, but then they are
the principal instigators of all the attacks on inoffensive
tribes. They rather than the men were greedy after heads,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>and scoff at their husbands or sweethearts as milksops if they
remain at home, and do not go forth to massacre and plunder.
In fact, the destruction of their homes strikes the women to
the heart, and turns them into advocates of peace. Among
the Dayaks the women are a predominant power. The
Dayaks are as woman-ridden and as henpecked as are Englishmen.
Moreover, the destruction of native buildings is a more
merciful proceeding than the slaying of a number of men in
battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the return of this ravaging party, which had done a
circuit of thirty miles, a day was given to rest, and then
the main body prepared to march to Sadok; and this time
the expedition was furnished with a mortar that was expected
to bring down Rentap's fortification. It was a six-pounder
and only a few inches long, and was carried by
Dayaks slung in a network of rattans.</p>

<p class='c000'>Without opposition the host approached the fort of
Sadok.</p>

<p class='c013'>We met with no obstacles in mounting to the summit, which we
reached at a little past ten in the morning. Rentap's party were within
his wooden walls, and not a living being could be seen. Our force set
to collect wood, and within an hour a small stockade was erected, in
which our mortar was arranged; it was mounted within easy firing
distance of the enemy's fortress, and, under the superintendence of
Mr. John Channon, the firing commenced. The shells were thrown
with great precision, often lodging under the roof of the enemy's fort;
at other times bursting over it, and more than once, we heard them
burst in the middle inside. Not a word was spoken by them, and
some were under the impression that the place was deserted, when
the tapping of the old gong would recommence as blithe as ever.
Fifty rounds of shell were fired, besides hollow ones with full charges
of powder, all of which appeared to take no more effect than if we
were pitching pebbles at them. None of our party yet dared venture
too near, but some of the most energetic pushed on to another
stockade, within a few fathoms of the fort, when the enemy commenced
firing, but the shot did not penetrate the wood. Our young Dayaks
advanced, and two were immediately knocked over and others
wounded. Other parties also advanced, and an active scene ensued;
some reached the planking of the fortress, sheltering their heads with
their shields, showers of stones were thrown from the inside, and
spears were jabbed from a platform above. There was such a
commotion for a few minutes, that I made certain our party were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>effecting an entrance, and, for the purpose of supporting them, I
rushed out of our stockade, followed by a few, but had not passed
on over more than four or five feet, before the enemy fired grape,
wounding a fine young Dayak behind me, whom I had just time
enough to save from falling down the precipice by seizing him by the
hair, and passing him on to others behind the stockade. My brother
and I advanced a few steps, but found our following was too inadequate
for storming, and many were already retreating. Volleys of stones
were flying round our heads, and as we retired again behind the
stockade another charge of grape poured into the wood now at our
backs. The chiefs had congregated to beg us to desist from making
any further advance, and I must admit that we only risked our lives
needlessly. The natives wisely observed, "We cannot pull these
planks down with our hands, we cannot climb over them, and our
arms make no impression on the enemy."</p>

<p class='c000'>It was therefore resolved to abandon the attack. The
retreat was begun at once, Rentap's followers shouting after
the party the mocking words, 'Bring all your fire-guns from
England, we are not afraid of you,' and discharging shot
and spears and poisoned arrows. The enemy, yelling in
triumph, threatened the assailants as they retired down the
hill, but kept at a decent distance or hid behind cover for
fear of the firearms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus ended the second attempt on Sadok, again a failure.
The mortar had not answered its purpose, nothing but a
cannon could effect a breach in the solid palisading of the
fortress. This venture was made in 1858, and no further
attack on Sadok was attempted till 1861. There were other
grave matters to engage the attention of the Rajah and his
nephews, and although the upper Saribas were continuously
troublesome, and had to be checked and reprisals made for
their onslaughts on the peaceable Dayaks, for three years
no attempt could be undertaken to dislodge Rentap.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in 1861, it was resolved finally to assault and
humble him. Meanwhile a good many of Rentap's followers
had deserted him, and he was no longer popular. His violence
and wilfulness had alienated many, and more had come to
see that under the Sarawak Government the Dayaks who
submitted were contented and flourishing. He had moreover
offended their prejudices. He had descended from his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>eyrie, carried off a girl, discarded his old wife, and elevated
the young one to be Ranee of Sadok. This was a grave
violation of Dayak custom, and was resented accordingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>On September 16, 1861, an expedition under the
command of the Tuan Muda was ready to start up the
Saribas river to dislodge Rentap. According to the received
axiom, a third time is lucky, and on this occasion success
was achieved.</p>

<p class='c000'>The new expedition was to be better furnished than had
been those which preceded it, and was to take with it
rockets, a 12-pounder gun, and a 6-pounder; a working
party of twenty Chinamen to make roads and throw up
earthworks, a force of Sidi boys or negroes, daring fellows,
ready to storm the stockade, and numerous Malays and
Dayaks. On October 20, the expedition reached Nanga
Tiga, the old position in 1858, and there once more the
boats were left, a stockade erected, and the 6-pounder
mounted in it. The land party then advanced over
the same ground as before, the guides leading the way,
followed by the Chinese and the Sidi boys; the Europeans
being placed in the centre. Rain came down in torrents, as
on the former occasion, and a difficulty ensued in getting
the Chinamen to keep the powder dry.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 25th, the foot of Sadok was reached, whereupon
two chiefs, the brothers Loyoh and Nanang, came in and made
their submission, but this was accepted only after the payment
of a fine of forty rusa jars worth £400, which were to
be retained for three years, and then returned to the tribe,
or their chiefs, should they remain loyal; and eventually
they were restored. Rentap got wind of this, and sent out
a party who set fire to Nanang's house, which was close to
his on Sadok.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gun was slung on a long pole, and sixty men were
detailed to convey it up the mountain, but this could be
effected by the means of ropes alone. No opposition was
offered by Rentap, although four hours were consumed in
transporting the gun to the summit. At 4.30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> of the
28th, it was in position, but as a dense mist had rolled down
enveloping the mountain top, nothing could be done with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>the gun till 7.30, when the mist had cleared away; and then
such a raging wind was blowing, that the rockets could not
be used. The gun was discharged, but, after the seventeenth
round, the carriage gave way; however, it had effected the
purpose for which it had been brought up, by tearing gaps
in the stockade of Rentap's fortress, and now, under cover of
a volley of musketry, the storming party rushed over the
neck of rock, and dashed in at the gaps that had been made.
They found the fortress deserted by all but the dead and
dying. Rentap, perceiving that it was no longer tenable,
had fled with his men down the opposite end of the mountain.
In the fortress were found the arms captured when he fought
with Brereton and Lee, in 1853, and a large quantity of
ammunition, which had been supplied by Sherip Masahor;
also, amongst others, a brass cannon taken from a gunboat
belonging to the Sultan of Pontianak that had been captured
by Rentap in 1837 off Mempawa, in sight of her consort, a
Dutch gunboat. In the afternoon of the same day, fuel
was heaped about the stockade and long houses; a gun was
fired, and in ten minutes a column of fire mounted and was
carried in blazing streamers before the wind. As the darkness
settled down, the summit of Sadok was glowing and shooting
up tongues of flame like a volcano, visible for miles around,
and proclaiming unmistakably the end of Rentap's domination
as Rajah of the interior.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rentap will not be noticed again. Broken, and deserted
by all, he retired to the Entabai branch of the Kanowit,
where he died some years later.</p>

We must take a retrospective
glance before proceeding with
the subject of this chapter, in
order to note briefly some important
incidents, which have not
been recorded in their proper
sequence, so as not to interrupt
a connected narrative of the
events related in the preceding chapter. During the period
covered by that chapter happened the grave disturbances
caused by Sherip Masahor, aided by the disaffection of the
Datu Patinggi Gapur, and backed by Bruni intrigue; also
the troubles at Muka, which ended in the cession to the raj
of that and neighbouring towns, with the intermediate country
up to point Kedurong. Both occurred previously to Rentap's
overthrow, but subsequently to the Chinese insurrection, and
both will be fully related in the two following chapters.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1850, as we have already recorded, the Chinese
colony in Upper Sarawak had been greatly augmented by
the arrival of some thousands of Chinese refugees from
Pemangkat in Dutch territory, who had come over into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Sarawak to escape the tyranny of their stronger rivals, the
Chinese of Montrado.</p>

<p class='c000'>These Chinese were mostly gold miners, and had
established themselves at Bau, Bidi, Paku, and Tundong, under
one Kongsi, or company, to exploit the mines in the vicinity
of these villages. Bau, their principal village, was the
headquarters of the Kongsi. Others had settled at Siniawan,
and Segobang, but these were agriculturists, and harmless
people, though they were reluctantly dragged into rebellion
by the machinations of the Secret Society formed by the
turbulent mining communities, and became involved in the
ruin that followed its attempt to overthrow the Government.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Kuching there was also a fairly large number of
Chinese, consisting mainly of merchants and traders, mostly
well-to-do people, whose interests, as well as racial antagonism,
placed them, then as now, in opposition to the principles of
such secret societies, which aimed at the subversion of all
constituted authority, and the substitution of terrorism.</p>

<p class='c000'>For years past a secret society had been forming in
Upper Sarawak, with its headquarters at Bau. It was not
the product of any discontent with the Rajah's Government,
to which its members had fled for protection from the tyranny
to which they had been subjected over the border, but was
formed by a few ambitious and unscrupulous men and their
adherents to gain power, and these were principally the
scattered remains of societies which had been driven out of
Dutch territory.</p>

<p class='c000'>The name of the Society was the Sam-Tiau-Kiau Hueh,<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c011'><sup>[208]</sup></a>
and it was amalgamated with the great Thien-Ti<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c011'><sup>[209]</sup></a> Hueh, or
Triad Society of China, which was firmly established in
Singapore, and had its ramifications throughout the East.
The Thien-Ti Hueh had its rise in the 17th century, and
had a political origin. The object was the restoration of the
Ming dynasty, which in the person of Tsung-Cheng was cut
off by the Manchus in or about 1628. The Society is called
"Triad," it being also known by the name of Sam-hap or
"three united"—a Triad of Heaven, Earth, and Man; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>these forces, where brought into perfect unity, produce
peace and harmony. But it has entirely lost its political
character, and has become socialistic and anarchical.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c011'><sup>[210]</sup></a>
Although the maxim or motto of the Society is "Obey
Heaven and work Righteousness," these objects are the very
last sought by the members. Both in China and in the
Dutch Colonies the League is forbidden by severe laws, and
in Sarawak since 1870 the punishment for being the leader
of any secret society is death. In China itself, to be found
in possession of any books, seals or insignia of the Triad
Society would render a person liable to decapitation, or
subject him to a persecution to which even death would be
preferable. The sure sign of the beginning of activity of a
Society for some object it has set before it is a series of
murders of those Chinese who have refused to join it, who
have incurred its displeasure, or who are mistrusted. His
blood is drunk, and an ear sent to the head of the Society,
in token that he has been put to death. In Singapore it is
now less noxious. There, every Society has to be registered
and reported; and no secret society is allowed to meet that
has not conformed to regulations, that deprive it of half its
secrecy.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c011'><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There is not a shrewder or more industrious man under
the sun than the yellow Chinaman. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il engraisse le sol où
il est planté</span>," as Napoleon said of the Englishman. He is
an admirable market-gardener, and will get more out of half
an acre of land than any man else. He is a diligent planter,
miner, and artisan, possesses great ability as a merchant, and
is indispensable for the proper development of tropical
countries. But in a good many exists an invincible love of
belonging to a secret society, and such a society, although
nominally a benefit-club, is really a hotbed of anarchy.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it gathered strength the Sam-Tiau-Kiau Hueh became
contumacious and insolent. As early as the close of 1850
it had brought itself conspicuously to the attention of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Rajah, and the principal men were warned to desist in time.
This warning was unheeded, and a little later it was discovered
that members were being enrolled by persuasion and threats,
and that an agent of the Triad Society had come over from
Singapore to further its objects. This man, Kah Yun, was
arrested and sentenced to death, and others were fined and
flogged. In 1852, the Chinese in Upper Sarawak, who had
more than once before been turbulent and rebellious, openly
resisted a Government officer, and prevented him from arresting
a criminal, a member of the Hueh. The Tuan Muda
was sent to the spot with a force, but, though well armed,
the Chinese did not then feel themselves strong enough to
resist, and offered the most humble obeisance, delivering up
the culprit. They were then ordered to build a fort at
Belidah, below Siniawan, to equip it with arms and ammunition,
and to pay the wages of the fortmen. The fort, which
was to be a check on the Chinese, was built, and placed in
charge of Sherip Matusain, with a small garrison of Malays.
The Chinese had been steadily collecting arms and ammunition
for some time past, and they were now ordered to deliver
up a hundred muskets, but the demand was afterwards
relinquished. This was a mistake, as they had no need of
firearms for their protection, living as they did amongst the
peaceable Land Dayaks, and the Tuan Muda was rightly of
opinion that they had not been sufficiently humbled, nor
their power sufficiently weakened. To the Hueh, however,
the lesson was useful—it showed them the strength of the
Government, and taught them that submission would be wise
until they were better prepared.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Sarawak in 1857 there were about 4000 of these
yellow men, located mainly in the mining district. There
were numerous settlements over the frontier in the territories
of the Sultan of Sambas, where also the people were engaged
on the gold mines, and the Hueh could rely upon their active
aid.</p>

<p class='c000'>A good deal of smuggling of opium had been in progress,
and evidence was obtained that convicted the Kongsi of gold-miners
at Bau of having been engaged in this illicit trade;
whereupon it was fined £150, a small sum considering the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>amount that the revenue had been defrauded by their means.
This fine was imposed a month only before the outbreak
occurred; it was paid, and the Hueh feigned submission.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sultan of Sambas had long been jealous of the
growing prosperity of Sarawak, and of the contrast afforded
to his own misrule by the liberal and good government there.
Moreover, numerous Land-Dayaks from Sambas had moved
into the Rajah's territories for the sake of the protection
there afforded, which they could not obtain under the Sultan.
He was accordingly willing to encourage any attempt made
to overthrow the government of the Rajah.</p>

<p class='c000'>In October, 1856, trouble with China began, and
Commissioner Yeh, defying Sir John Bowring and Admiral
Seymour, publicly offered a reward of thirty dollars for
every English head. Rumour of this, greatly magnified into
a general slaughter and expulsion of the English, had reached
the Chinese in Singapore, where an outbreak took place in
1857, and Sarawak, where signs of unrest among the
Chinese became apparent. The Commission of Inquiry
into the conduct of the Rajah greatly tended to encourage
the Chinese to revolt. They believed that the British
Government strongly disapproved of the rule of the Rajah,
and would not lift a finger to maintain it. There was but a
handful of white men in Sarawak, and the Land-Dayaks
were well known to be a timorous people, indisposed to
war. It was also thought that there was a body there
of disaffected Malays, under the influence of the Rajah's old
adversary, the Pangiran Makota, who was now supreme in
Bruni, governing the mind of the imbecile Sultan, and watching
for every opportunity of upsetting the rule of the English
Rajah in the south.</p>

<p class='c000'>The headmen of the Kongsi accordingly resolved upon
striking a sudden blow, mastering Kuching, and sweeping
the Rajah and all his officials out of the place. But, so as
not to give occasion to the British Government to interfere,
they determined to massacre them only, and to spare the
lives of the few English merchants and missionaries resident
at Kuching, and not members of the Rajah's staff.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the close of 1856, the Rajah was at Singapore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>whither he had gone to recruit, as he was much out of
health. His nephew, the Tuan Muda, was at Sekrang,
engaged on the construction of a new fort, when he received
a letter from the principal official in Kuching, requesting
him to be present at the Chinese New Year, and informing
him that he had received disquieting intelligence about
the Chinese gold-miners, who, under the plea of erecting a
new joss or idol, or Tai-pi-kong,<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c011'><sup>[212]</sup></a> meditated an attack on
Kuching, and an attempt to overthrow the Government and
establish their own independent rule. The Tuan Muda at
once sought Abang Aing, the principal Sekrang chief, a
man to be thoroughly trusted, but he was laid up with
small-pox, and unable to help.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He spoke very kindly and to the purpose, telling me
plainly that he did not like the sound of the reports, and
begged me to be careful. He regretted that he could not
go himself, but would send a younger brother, and urge the
Orang Kaya to accompany me, and he promised to arrange
so as to follow me if anything serious really occurred. No
Christian could have offered advice in a kinder tone or better
spirit."</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly the Tuan Muda hastened to Kuching, but
found that all was quiet there, and it was supposed that
the reports were unnecessarily alarming. Thus satisfied, he
departed, and returned to Sekrang. Mr. Arthur Crookshank,
then in charge at Kuching during the absence of the Rajah
and the Tuan Besar, who was in England, however, took
the precaution to man the small stockades, which constituted
the only defences of the town, with a sufficient
garrison.</p>

<p class='c000'>On February 14, 1857, four days before the insurrection
broke out, a Chinaman, who had formerly been expelled
from Sarawak territory for joining a secret society, appeared
in Bruni, and was detected attempting to induce the
Chinese servants of Mr. Spenser St. John, then Consul-General
there, to enter the Thien-ti Secret Society; and
encouraging them to do so with the assurance that a general
massacre of the white men in Sarawak was in contemplation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>and that the Chinese would establish their own supremacy
there. It is therefore by no means improbable that he was
an agent of the Kongsi sent to Bruni, to communicate the
plan of insurrection to Makota. Moreover, it was ascertained
that overtures had been made to certain disaffected Malays
in Sarawak to shut their eyes, if they did not feel inclined
for actual co-operation in the attempt.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the Rajah's return to Kuching from Singapore, Mr.
Crookshank told him of the disquieting rumours, and of what
he had done for the protection of the capital. And, although
Mr. Middleton, the Inspector of Police, confirmed his
opinion that precautions should be taken, the Rajah could
not be induced to believe that there was danger, and unwisely
dismissed the garrison from the forts, and no efficient
watch was kept.</p>

<p class='c000'>On February 18, the chief of the Kongsi assembled
about six hundred of the ablest-bodied Chinamen belonging
to the Society at Bau, armed them and marched to Tundong
on the Sarawak river, where a squadron of large boats had
been prepared to carry them to Kuching.</p>

<p class='c013'>"During their slow passage down the river," says Mr. St. John,
"a Malay who was accustomed to trade with the Chinese overtook
them in a canoe and actually induced them to permit him to pass,
under the plea that his wife and children lived in a place called
Batu Kawa, eight miles above the town, and would be frightened
if they heard so many men passing, and he not there to reassure
them. Instead of going home, he pulled down as fast as he could
till he reached the town of Kuching, and going straight to his
relative, a Malay trader of the name of Gapur, who was a trustworthy
and brave man, told him what he had seen; but Gapur said,
'Don't go and tell the chief or the Rajah such a tissue of absurdities,'
yet he went himself over to the Bandar and informed him, but the
Datu's answer was, 'The Rajah is unwell, we have heard similar
reports for the last twenty years—don't go and bother him about
it. I will tell him in the morning what your relative says.' This
great security was caused by the universal belief that the Chinese
could not commit so great a folly as to attempt to seize the government
of the country, considering that they did not number above
4000, while at that time the Malays and Dayaks within the Sarawak
territories amounted to 200,000 at least. It is strange, however,
and was an unpardonable neglect of the Bandar, not to have sent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>a fast boat up the river to ascertain what was really going on.
Had he done so, the town and numerous lives would have been
saved."</p>

<p class='c000'>Shortly after midnight the squadron arrived unnoticed,
and dividing into two parties proceeded to surprise the
Government buildings and the stockades. The details of
the attack on the Rajah's house and of his escape are given
in an account by his steward, Charles Penty. Mr. Penty
says:—</p>

<p class='c013'>I was sleeping in a room near the Rajah, who had not been
well for some days. The attack took place about midnight, with
fearful yelling and firing. I hurried out of bed, and met the Rajah
in the passage in the dark, who at the moment took me for one of
the rebels, grappled me by the throat, and was about to shoot me,
when he fortunately discovered it was me. We then opened the
venetian window of my room and saw poor Mr. Nicholetts
murdered before our eyes. The Rajah said, "Ah, Penty, it will
be our turn next."</p>

<p class='c013'>Then we went to another part of the house, where the crowd
of rebels was even thicker. The Rajah seemed determined to fight.
While he was loading a double-barrel gun for my use, our light
went out and he had to do without. The Rajah then led the way
to his bathroom, under his bedroom, and rushed out of the door.
The rebels, having gathered round poor Mr. Nicholetts' body, left
the way pretty clear, and the Rajah, with his sword and revolver in
hand, made his way to a small creek and swam under the bow of a
boat that had brought the rebels.<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c011'><sup>[213]</sup></a> Being unable to swim, I ran
up the plantation and rushed into the jungle. The Rajah's
beautiful house was blazing from end to end, and the light reflected
for a great distance. Mr. Crookshank's and Mr. Middleton's
houses were also burning. At daybreak I heard Malay voices;
they, like myself, were running away from the town, which was in
the hands of the rebels. They kindly clothed me and took me to
the Rajah.</p>

<p class='c000'>After diving under the Chinese boat, the Rajah had
swum across the creek, where he lay exhausted on the mud
bank for a while, until sufficiently recovered to be able to
reach the house of a Malay official, where shortly after he was
joined by Mr. Crookshank and Mr. Middleton. The Mr.
Nicholetts who was murdered before the eyes of the Rajah
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>was a promising young officer, who had just arrived from
Lundu on a visit, and was lodged in a cottage near the
Rajah's house.<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c011'><sup>[214]</sup></a> Startled from his sleep by the yells of the
Chinese, he rushed from his door, when the rebels fell on
him, hacked off his head, and, putting it on a pike, paraded
the town with it, shouting that they had killed the Rajah
himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Imminent as their own danger was, the Malays did not
forget the Rajah, and a gallant little band led by Haji Bua
Hasan, then the Datu Imaum, hastened to his aid, though
they were too late; and they had to fight their way back.</p>

<p class='c013'>"The other attacks," says Mr. St. John, "took place simultaneously.
Mr. and Mrs. Crookshank, rushing forth on hearing this midnight
alarm, were cut down—the latter left for dead, the former seriously
wounded. The constable's house was attacked, but he and his wife
escaped, while their two children and an English lodger were killed
by the insurgents. Here occurred a scene which shows how
barbarous were the Chinese. When the rebels burst into Mr.
Middleton's house, he fled, and his wife following found herself in
the bathroom, and by the shouts was convinced that her retreat was
cut off. In the meantime the Chinese had seized her two children,
and brought the eldest down into the bathroom to show the way his
father had escaped. Mrs. Middleton's only refuge was a large water-jar;
there she heard the poor little boy questioned, pleading for his
life, and heard his shriek when the fatal sword was raised which
severed his head from his body. The fiends kicked the little head
with loud laughter from one to another. They then set fire to the
house, and she distinctly heard the second child shrieking as they
tossed him into the flames. Mrs. Middleton remained in the jar
till the falling embers forced her to leave. She then got into a
neighbouring pond, and thus escaped the eyes of the Chinese, who
were frantically rushing about the burning house. Her escape was
most extraordinary.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c011'><sup>[215]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>"The stockades, however, were not surprised. The Chinese,
waiting for the signal of attack on the houses, were at length perceived
by the sentinel, and he immediately roused the treasurer, Mr.
Crymble, who resided in the stockade, which contained the arsenal
and the prison. He endeavoured to make some preparation for
defence, although he had but four Malays with him. He had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>scarcely time, however, to load a 6-pounder field-piece, and get his
own rifle ready, before the Chinese with loud shouts rushed to the
assault. They were led by a man bearing in each hand a flaming
torch. Mr. Crymble waited until they were within forty yards, he
then fired and killed the man who, by the light he bore, made
himself conspicuous, and, before the crowd recovered from the
confusion in which they were thrown by the fall of their leader,
discharged among them the 6-pounder loaded with grape, which
made the assailants retire behind the neighbouring houses, or hide in
the outer ditches. But, with four men, little could be done; and some
of the rebels having quietly crossed the inner ditch, commenced
removing the planks which constituted the only defence. To add
to the difficulty, they threw over into the inner court little iron
tripods, with flaming torches attached, which rendered it as light as
day, while they remained shrouded in darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>"To increase the number of the defenders, Mr. Crymble released
two Malay prisoners, one a madman who had killed his wife, the
other a debtor. This latter quickly disappeared, while the former,
regardless of the shot flying around, stood to the post assigned him,
opposite a plank which the Chinese were trying to remove. He had
orders to fire his carbine at the first person who appeared, and, the
plank giving way, a man attempted to force his body through, he
pulled the trigger without lowering the muzzle of his carbine, and
sent the ball through his own brains. Mr. Crymble now found it
useless to prolong the struggle, as one of his few men was killed,
and another, a brave Malay corporal, was shot down at his side.
The wounded man begged Mr. Crymble to fly and leave him there,
but asked to shake hands with him first, and tell him whether he
had not done his duty. The brave Irishman seized him by the arm
and attempted to drag him up the stairs leading to the dwelling over
the gate, but the Chinese had already gained the courtyard, and
pursuing them, drove their spears through the wounded man, and
Mr. Crymble was forced to let go his hold, and with a brave follower,
Daud, swung himself down into the ditch below. Some of the
rebels, seeing their attempt to escape, tried to stop Mr. Crymble, and
a man stabbed at him, but only glanced his thick frieze coat, and
received in return a cut across the face from the Irishman's cutlass,
which was a remembrance to carry to the grave.</p>

<p class='c013'>"The other stockade, though it had been but a corporal's watch
of three Malays, did not surrender, but finding that every other place
was in the hands of the Chinese, the brave defenders opened their
gates and, charging the crowd of rebels, sword in hand, made their
escape, though they were all severely wounded in the attempt.</p>

<p class='c013'>"The confusion which reigned throughout the rest of the town
may be imagined, as, startled by the shouts and yells of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>Chinese, the inhabitants rushed to the doors and windows, and
beheld night turned into day by the bright flames which rose in
three directions, where the Rajah's, Mr. Crookshank's, and Mr.
Middleton's houses were all burning at the same time."</p>

<p class='c000'>Those English whose dwellings had not been attacked
gathered in the Mission-house, to the number of six men
with eight or more children. All the men had guns, and it
was resolved that they should endeavour to keep the Chinese
back till the ladies had made their escape into the jungle.
The Bishop, armed like the rest, gave his blessing to the
whole party that united in brief prayer; but with the first
streaks of daylight a party of seven Chinese came to the
Mission-house, saying that their quarrel was with the Government
only, and not with the English generally. They
requested the Bishop to go with them to the hospital to
attend to some thirteen or fourteen<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c011'><sup>[216]</sup></a> of their men who had
been wounded in the attack upon the fort.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Rajah as soon as possible proceeded to the Datu Bandar's
house, and being quickly joined by his English officers, endeavoured
to organise a force to surprise the victorious Chinese, but it was
impossible. No sooner did he collect a few men than their wives
and children surrounded them and refused to be left,—and being
without proper arms or ammunition, it was but a panic-stricken mob;
so he instantly took his determination with that decision which had
been the foundation of his success, and giving up the idea of an
immediate attack, advised the removal of the women and children
to the left-hand bank of the river, where they would be safe from a
land attack of the Chinese, who could make their way along the
right-hand bank by a road at the back of the town.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c011'><sup>[217]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>By the morning the women and children had been
moved across, and the Rajah and his officers, having been
joined by Abang Buyong<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c011'><sup>[218]</sup></a> and some armed Malays, proceeded
to the Samarahan, intending to go on to the Batang Lupar,
and fall back on the well-equipped forts there to organise a
force to drive out the rebels.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning the Chinese chiefs summoned the
Bishop; Mr. L. V. Helms, Manager of the Borneo Company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Limited; Mr. Rupell, a merchant, and the Datu Bandar, to
appear before them in the Court-house. Seated on the
Rajah's chair, the head Chief, supported by his secretaries,
issued his orders that Mr. Helms and Mr. Rupell were to
rule the foreign portion of the town, and the Datu Bandar
the Malays, under the Kongsi as supreme rulers. The
Bishop now warned the Chinese that they were playing a
desperate game, that the Tuan Muda would be coming down
upon them, with his host of Sekrang and Balau warriors, to
avenge the death of his uncle and his friends—for most of
them supposed the Rajah dead. Discouragement fell upon
the Chinese, for they remembered that the Tuan Muda was
the daring and popular leader of the Sea-Dayaks, and could
bring many thousands of these wild warriors against them.
They therefore decided to send him a letter to the effect
that they would not interfere with him so long as he did not
interfere with them, and confined himself to the districts
under his government.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The leaders also knowing that the Rajah was not killed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>had offered a large reward for his capture, dead or alive, for
what he was preparing they knew not. They were now
doubly anxious to leave Kuching with their plunder, they
therefore called upon the Europeans and the Malay chiefs
present to swear fidelity to the Kongsi, and this they were
forced to do under fear of instant death.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day at noon the Chinese retired up-river with
their boats heavily laden with cannon, rifles, plate, money, and
all the valuables upon which they could lay their hands. The
Malay chiefs at once held a meeting at the Datu Bandar's
house, when sturdy Abang Pata, the Datu Temanggong's son,
avowed his determination to remain faithful to the Rajah
and at once to wreck vengeance on his enemies. Though
all were as faithful, wiser counsels prevailed, the Malays
being so scattered, conveying their women and children to
places of safety, that no organised attack could yet be made;
but Pata impetuously dashed off with a dozen men in a small
canoe, and following the Chinese, captured one of their boats,
killing five of the crew. This, and the news reaching them
that the Malays were preparing to resist, brought the Chinese
back, recruited by several hundreds from Upper Sarawak,
and the agriculturists of Segobang, whom they had forced to
join them, and when the Rajah returned at the earnest
request of the chiefs to lead them against the Chinese,
a request he complied with, though he knew it was useless,
he found the rest of the English flying, the town in the
hands of the Chinese, and the Malay houses burning.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the Chinese boats were seen rounding the
point above the town, the Malays gallantly dashed at them,
and succeeded in capturing ten of their largest barges. They
were, however, pressed back by the more numerous and better
armed Chinese, and, though they lost heavily, they doggedly
retreated retaining their prizes, which were laden with valuable
plunder, and, what was of more use to them, a quantity of
arms and ammunition, and secured them to a large trading
vessel anchored in the centre of the river. Here they maintained
a determined resistance, which they were now better
able to do, and effectually defied the Chinese to dislodge them.
They were commanded by the Datu Bandar Muhammad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Lana, a grave and gentle Malay, who now showed the courage
of his father, the late Datu Patinggi Ali. The Chinese still
held the town in force.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah was again forced to retire, to carry out his
original intention of rallying his people up the coast, but his
first care was to see to the safety of the ladies, the English
non-combatants, and the wounded, and to send them off to
safety at Lingga fort under the care of the Bishop in a
schooner. Despondently he prepared next day to follow
with a small flotilla of Malay boats, but at the mouth of the
river, to his intense relief, the Borneo Company's steamer, the
<cite>Sir James Brooke</cite>, arriving from Singapore, met them. The
vanguard of the Tuan Muda's force, which was quickly
coming to his relief, was also arriving, and now the tide had
changed, and the day of reckoning had come.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sight of the steamer and the Dayak bangkongs
eagerly following was quite sufficient for the Chinese. They
fired one wild volley, and fled panic-stricken, with the ships'
guns playing on them, and pursued by the Dayaks and
Malays.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Datu Bandar's gallant band on board the trader and
in war-boats around her had stood their ground in spite of
heavy guns having been brought to bear upon them, and they
now assumed the offensive. The Chinese, that morning, had
crossed the river to destroy the Malay town on the other
side; their boats were now seized, and the Dayaks pursued
them into the jungle. Of that large party, not one can have
escaped. Those who were not killed wandered into the
jungle and died of starvation, or hanged themselves. Their
bodies were eagerly sought for, as on many were found from
five to twenty pounds sterling, besides silver spoons, forks,
or other valuables, the plunder of the English houses.</p>

<p class='c000'>The main body of the Chinese retired by road to Segobang,
and from thence up-river in their boats.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have already recorded how the news had been brought
to the Tuan Muda at Sekrang, and how he hurried with his
Dayaks to the Rajah's rescue, to find him safe and in good
health, though crippled by the injuries he had received, on
board the <cite>Sir James Brooke</cite>, which he had made his headquarters.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Kuching was wrecked—"a mass of ashes, and
confusion and ruin lay around. Half-habitable <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</span> of
houses only were left. The trees for many hundred yards
around the fires were nearly all burnt black and leafless, and
those remaining alive were drooping," so the Tuan Muda
wrote, and we will now follow his account of the retribution
which the rebels so deservedly met.</p>

<p class='c000'>To check the pursuing boats of the Dayaks and Malays,
the Chinese had thrown up a strong stockade at Lidah Tanah
(lit. the tongue of land), a point of land at the junction of the
right and left hand branches of the river. Here they placed
a picked garrison under trusted leaders, and the stockade was
well armed with guns and rifles that had been taken from
Kuching.</p>

<p class='c000'>A small force of Malays, and several hundreds of Sekrang
and Saribas Dayaks were organised to attack it, and the mild
Datu Bandar, in his new <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</span> of a redoubtable warrior, led
them with such dash that the position was soon carried.
Amongst the trophies that were brought back by the Dayaks
the Chinese merchants recognised the heads of some of the
principal leaders of the rebels, and showed marked satisfaction
that such was the case.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah and the Tuan Muda then pushed on to
Belidah, about eight miles above Lidah Tanah. Here the
fort was found to have been destroyed, the rebels having left
little behind them in their retreat but desolation and misery.
The Malays and Dayaks were then despatched under Abang
Buyong to attack the Chinese, but these latter were in full
retreat from Bau, and their other villages, towards the border;
once across they would be safe:</p>

<p class='c013'>but the dogs of war were at their heels, harassing and cutting them
off at every opportunity. Their plan of retreat was very skilfully
arranged, and a fanatical idea of the infallibility of their Joss (idol),
which they carried with them, kept them in order. We were helpless
to a certain extent, in being unable to gather together an organised
force, or we should have routed them without doubt, and fearful loss
of life would have been the consequence. In looking back on these
events, it was perhaps fortunate that we were not able to act more
unitedly against them, but if it had been within our power at that
time, the Joss undoubtedly would have been overturned, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>people exterminated. The most merciful of men could not deny
that they had richly merited such a punishment. They protected
this image with the utmost caution, keeping their women and children
around it, while their bravest men acted as a guard on the outside.
They had advanced a considerable distance before the Dayaks
approached. The Dayak leaders on closing were at once shot
down. This made the others more cautious. But the Chinamen
had our best rifles and arms, with all the necessary accoutrements
belonging to them. The Dayaks then changed their tactics, and did
not dare appear in the open road again, but entered the jungle on
each side of the enemy, and thus harassed them continually, cutting
off every straggler without mercy. The Chinamen were powerless to
follow these wild cat-like fellows into the close jungles, and were
obliged to submit to their fate as best they might. The road over
which the rebels were retreating was one continued track of clothes,
valuables, silver plate, and dead bodies. To enable their retreating
force to gain a few minutes whilst passing precipitous places, they
strewed the road with rice, and threw here and there a valuable article
to retard and keep off their pursuers. This continued for several
successive days, during which the Chinese must have suffered
intensely. They were not even able to cook or sleep by night or
day. They now arrived at a point which must have ended their
career, if it had been properly held. This was Gombang Hill,
which forms the frontier between Sambas and Sarawak: here was a
long Dayak house, past which the Chinese could not go unless the
inhabitants were favourably disposed to them;<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c011'><sup>[219]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class='c000'>but these suffered themselves to be bribed into permitting
the rebels to pass unmolested. Thus the survivors of the
Chinese escaped into Sambas territory.</p>

<p class='c000'>But no sooner were they there than those of the Chinese
who did not belong to the Secret Society, filled with resentment
against the members of that league for having involved
them in such disaster, fell upon them, and killed many of
them, reducing the hundred of the original band of 600, who
had survived the muskets and spears of the Dayaks, to
between thirty and forty. To add to their discomfiture, the
Dutch officers came upon them and despoiled them of all the
arms and plunder they had succeeded in bringing with them,
and placed them under strict surveillance. The Dutch
Government sent back to Kuching everything which was
considered to be public or private property.<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c011'><sup>[220]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>How many of the rebels were killed it has not been possible
to estimate, but it could not have been far short of 1000.
Sir Spenser estimates that 2000, of which half were women
and children, escaped over the borders, but this is probably
an under-estimate.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was the madness," wrote the Rajah, "the stark
staring folly of the attempt that caused it to succeed. With
mankind in general we may trust to their not doing anything
utterly opposed to reason; but this rule does not hold good
with the Chinese," who in their blindness of consequences
become daring and audacious, and, when possessed of power,
contemptuous of their adversaries, but who lose spirit on the
first reverse.</p>

<p class='c000'>April 15, witnessed the closing scene of the drama.
A prahu gaily decorated with flags and the yellow umbrella,
the symbol of authority, went up and down the river. A
gong was beaten, and then a man, standing among the flags
and umbrella, proclaimed peace, and announced that all
danger was at an end, and that every one might now put
away his arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>On March 28, when peace had been restored, H.M.S.
<em>Spartan</em> arrived, under Captain Sir William Hoste, from
Singapore, with instructions to protect British lives and
property, but with no orders to fire a gun, or to lend a
marine or blue-jacket for the protection of the Sarawak
Government. There was no knowing what the humanitarians
at home might say, should a finger be held out to assist the
Rajah. Those who lifted up their voices to justify the
pirates might now espouse the cause of the Chinese, and
again be loud in condemnation of the Rajah for having
summarily suppressed the insurrection. There will always
be found a man, as says Cordatus in Ben Jonson's <cite>Every
Man out of his Humour</cite>, "who will prefer all countries
before his native," and thinks every man right except an
Englishman.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dutch Resident at Pontianak behaved very
differently from the English authorities. He at once sent
a gunboat and troops to Sarawak with offers of assistance,
which, however, were not then required.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>The rebellion was "the direct outcome of the loss of
prestige and strength which followed the appointment of the
Commission sent to try the Rajah for high crimes and
misdemeanours, the favourable findings of which had never
been brought home to the native mind by any act of
reparation made by the British Government."<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c011'><sup>[221]</sup></a> The
Chinese knew that the Rajah had been left to his fate by
his country, and, as <cite>The Times</cite> commented,—</p>

<p class='c013'>had they (the Chinese) had the opportunity of reading recent
debates in the British Parliament, their more subtle spirits might
have received further encouragement from the belief that we were
not only an ultra-peaceful, but an ultra-punctilious people, and that
the cutting of Rajah Brooke's throat and the burning of the town
might be considered matters beyond our cognizance, until the precise
colonial status of Sarawak was determined, and whether a Kunsi
Chinese (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</span></i>, Chinese Kongsi) was under the jurisdiction of any
British court.</p>

<p class='c000'>And, the <cite>Daily News</cite>, which through ignorance of the
true circumstances had voiced the hostile opinion of the
cranks against the Rajah in the matter of the suppression
of the Saribas and Sekrang pirates, was candid enough to
admit</p>

<p class='c013'>having in the earlier part of Sir James Brooke's career felt it our
duty to express our dissent from, and disapproval of, certain parts of
his policy, we have sincere pleasure in proclaiming our unreserved
admiration of the manner in which he must have exercised his
power to have produced such fruits.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it was precisely that part of his policy that had been
condemned by Mr. Gladstone and the <cite>Daily News</cite> which
had produced these present marked effects.</p>

<p class='c000'>The condition of the Sarawak Government was now
serious, and surrounded with difficulties. The revenue was
gone. There was not a shred of a document extant to tell
the tale of former times. So complete was the ruin that
the Rajah had to wear native costume, which he borrowed
here and there.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there was a bright spot amid the gloom, in the devotion
of the natives; their sympathy, their kindness, their entire willingness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>to do what they could, are all balm to a wounded spirit. We
have lost everything but the hearts of the people, and that is much
to retain.<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c011'><sup>[222]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The fidelity of the natives of all races and classes was exemplary.
They everywhere took up arms to support the
Rajah and their Government, and had the Chinese been
twenty times as numerous, they would have been driven out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole of the Rajah's private capital had been long
ago exhausted, and how were the ruins to be cleared away
and the Government buildings to be rebuilt? how were the
servants of the State to be paid? Nevertheless the Rajah
and his staff faced their difficulties with courage and confidence;
but, deserted by the British Government, he was
sorely tempted to appeal to that of another power. Happily,
after a period of discouragement and resentment, he resolved
to face his difficulties, relying only on himself and his few
English assistants. He had on his right and left hand two
stout and able men, his two nephews.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within a short period many of the Chinese refugees,
particularly those of the agricultural class, returned and
rebuilt their old homes. Gradually their numbers were
added to by others from over the border, from the Straits,
and from China, until in time Upper Sarawak recovered its
former prosperity. The severe lesson they had learnt, which
had taught them how powerless they were to cope with the
forces at the call of the Government, that were not represented
merely by a handful of fortmen and policemen as
they had blindly imagined, did not, however, deter them
from forming another Hueh, which decreased and increased
in strength in proportion to the number of people in the
district. But the power of the Government has been steadily
growing, and what chance the Hueh may have ever hoped
to obtain of successfully opposing it has long ago vanished.
Dangerous and mischievous, however, these secret societies
can still be, unless vigilantly watched and swiftly suppressed,
and the Chinese population in Upper Sarawak has since
increased five-fold.</p>

<p class='c000'>For years the Bau Hueh remained dormant, though it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>had a perfect organisation, but in 1869 it raised its hand in
opposition to the Government, and barbarously murdered
an informer. Mr. Crookshank, who was administering the
Government in the absence of the present Rajah, took
prompt and energetic measures, and all the headmen of
the Hueh were arrested. They were condemned to long
terms of imprisonment and to be flogged. When their
terms had expired they were banished the country under a
penalty of death should they return; but the Hueh in Dutch
Borneo, of which this was a branch, immediately re-organised
the Society and appointed other office-bearers. Unfortunately
the register and records of this Hueh could not be found.
They had been cleverly concealed in the double-planked
floor of a bed-place which had been overturned in the search.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1884-85, the Secret Society was in active revolt
against the Dutch Government, which was at first only able
to hold the rebels in check, not having sufficient forces to
quell them. At Mandor, a large Chinese town, they killed
the Dutch official in charge, and burnt down the Government
buildings. After some hard fighting with great loss
on both sides, Mandor was surrendered by the rebels, upon
the false promise of an amnesty held out to them by the
Sultan of Sambas. Finding themselves deceived, the
Chinese again broke out in rebellion, and seized the important
town of Mempawa, killing, amongst others, the
Dutch officer in charge, and driving the Dutch troops back.
But their triumph was short-lived, for upon the arrival of
strong reinforcements the rebellion was quelled. One of
the principal leaders, the man who had shot the Dutch
controller of Mandor, was subsequently arrested in Sarawak,
but rather than face his fate he hanged himself by his queue
in his cell the day a Dutch gunboat had come round to
fetch him.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1889, a secret society, allied with the Sam Tiam<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c011'><sup>[223]</sup></a> or
Ghee Hin Hueh, a branch of the Triad Society of China,
was established at Segobang, the centre of a large district
of Chinese pepper planters. This Hueh had been formed by
criminals and expelled members of the Society from Mandor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>and Montrado. Their primary intention was to raise
another rebellion in Dutch territory, but they were banded by
oath to exterminate <em>all people without queues</em>. On July 15,
the houses of the chief and other known leaders were
surrounded and searched, and the inmates arrested. The
documents seized clearly showed the objects of the Society;
that they had hundreds of men organised and ready for
service; and that they were in correspondence with the
Ghee Hin Societies at Mandor and Singapore. Six of the
leaders were executed, and eleven sentenced to penal servitude
for life. One of the principals, who had taken a leading
part in the Mandor rebellion of 1884, was handed over
to the Dutch.</p>

<p>A CHINESE PROCESSION.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>As late as 1906, one or two mysterious murders of
Chinese in the Rejang aroused the suspicions of the
authorities, and it was found that a secret society existed on
that river. Valuable help was afforded the Government by
anonymous letters sent by law-abiding Chinese containing
minutely accurate information as to the members and their
doings, which led to the arrest of many, and to the discovery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>of incriminating documents. This Society was called the
Golden Orchid or Lily Society, and was established at
various places along the coast, from the Rejang to Simatan.
This was also a branch of the Triad Society, professing the
same great purpose, the reinstatement of the Ming dynasty
in China, but in practice its objects were murder, robbery,
and violence. Eight of the ringleaders were executed, and
ten others sentenced to long terms of imprisonment.</p>

When the Rajah
assumed the
Government of
Sarawak, he had
to look out for suitable
officials among
the Malays to carry
on the Government,
and suitable officials
were not easily to be
found where hitherto
all had been corruption
and oppression. There is not much choice in rotten apples.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were three offices of importance to be filled: that
of Datu Patinggi, he who had the supervision and control
over the tribes on the left-hand branch of the river; that of
Datu Bandar, he who held sway over those on the right
hand; and the Datu Temanggong, who had to look after
the tribes on the coast.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c011'><sup>[224]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It will be remembered that before the rebellion of the
Sarawak people against the Government of Bruni these
offices had been held by three of their chiefs, who, in 1841,
were reinstated in their old positions by the Rajah, and
made collectors of the revenue in their several districts.<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c011'><sup>[225]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>This was a tax levied on the head of a family of a bushel
and a half of rice. Hitherto the officers of Government, the
Bruni Pangirans great and small, had exercised the right
of pre-emption of whatever the Dayak produced, and that
at the prices they themselves fixed. Rajah Brooke modified,
but could not wholly abolish, this privilege. He suffered
these three officials, and them alone, to have the right to buy
before all others what the Dayaks had to dispose of, but
only at market price. With the others, the Datu Patinggi
Gapur had been in disgrace under Rajah Muda Hasim and
the Pangiran Makota. Any one who was looked on with an
evil eye by that arch-scoundrel Makota had a claim to be
regarded as an honest man, and for a while the Datu Patinggi
did fairly well, but this was only till he had, as he thought,
established himself firmly; and then he began to oppress
the natives in the old way, by enforcing sales to himself on
his own terms; and the timid people, accustomed to this
sort of treatment, and afraid of the consequences should
they protest, submitted without denouncing him to the
Rajah. He was a man plausible and polite, and some time
elapsed before the Rajah obtained sufficient evidence to
convict him. But when he did, instead of deposing him
from office, he announced his determination to pay each of
these officials a fixed salary, in lieu of the enforced first
trade with the Dayaks, and of their share in Dayak revenue.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Datu Patinggi had a handsome daughter who was
sought in marriage by a certain Sherip Bujang, brother of
Sherip Masahor of Serikei, who had assumed the government
of the Rejang river,<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c011'><sup>[226]</sup></a> and had long been in league with the
Saribas and Sekrang pirates—an evil-minded and intriguing
man. The Rajah was very averse to this marriage, but
could not forbid it. And the result was that Gapur and
Masahor put their heads together, confided to each other
their mutual grievances, and commenced plotting against
the Rajah and his officers. Serikei is 20 miles up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Rejang river, which was not yet within the jurisdiction of
Sarawak, but Saribas and Sekrang were, and Masahor was
a source of annoyance and danger by incessantly fomenting
agitation among the people of these rivers against the Rajah's
government, and supplying them with powder and arms.
For a while the Sadong district had been placed under the
charge of the Datu Patinggi as well as his own, but it was
found that, not satisfied with the salary paid by the
Government in lieu of the right of pre-emption, he was
enforcing that same right and using great oppression in both
districts. The Tuan Besar, who was then administering the
Government, went from Kuching to make a tour in both
these, and to ascertain whether the rumours relative to the
misconduct of Gapur were true, and by this means sufficient
proof of his illegal exactions was obtained.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Datu Patinggi had indeed pursued a course of
oppression ever since 1851, when the marriage between
Sherip Bujang and his daughter took place. He had levied
imposts on the Sarawak Dayaks, forced trade on the Matu
people, oppressed the Sadong Dayaks, and interfered at
Lingga and Serikei, and had even proceeded so far as to
assume the insignia of royalty by displaying a yellow (the
royal colour) flag and unfurling a yellow umbrella. He was
then, in November 1853, brought up in Court, publicly
reprimanded, and made to disgorge his plunder. He submitted
with outward tokens of goodwill, but he had been
publicly disgraced, and this he did not forget. His feeling
against the Government of the White Man became more
intensely bitter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in 1854, the Rajah and Captain Brooke, the Tuan
Besar, went up the Batang Lupar river to visit the Tuan
Muda at Lingga, and Brereton at Sekrang; Mr. Spenser
St. John was then at Kuching. This latter says:—</p>

<p class='c013'>One day, whilst sitting alone in my little cottage, the eldest son
of the Temanggong, Abang Patah, came in to have a talk. He was
one of the best of the Malay chiefs—frank, loyal, honest, brave as
a lion. He subsequently lost his life gallantly defending the Rajah's
Government.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c011'><sup>[227]</sup></a> I saw by his manner that he had something to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>communicate, so after answering a few leading questions he said,
"It is no use beating about the bush, I must tell you what is going
on." He then unfolded the particulars of a plot which the Patinggi
Gapur had concocted to cut off the Europeans in Sarawak. The
Patinggi had confided his plans to the other chiefs, but they had
almost unanimously refused to aid him, and had determined to keep
a watch over his proceedings, but they had not the moral courage to
denounce him to the Government. At length Abang Patah said,
"I have become alarmed. The Rajah and Captain Brooke are
away together. The Patinggi is with them with all his armed
followers, and in an unsuspecting moment all the British officers
might be cut off at a blow." I promised, as he desired, to keep his
communication a secret from all but the Rajah, to whom I instantly
wrote, giving not only Patah's story, but other indications which had
come to my knowledge. An express boat carried my letter to its
destination. The Rajah read the letter, and, without a word, passed
it to Captain Brooke. The latter, having also read it, said, "What
do you think?" "It is all too true," answered the Rajah, to whom
conviction came like an inspiration. They had noticed some very odd
proceedings on the part of the Patinggi, but, having no suspicions,
had not been able to interpret some of his armed movements, but
now it was quite clear that he was trying to get the Europeans
together to strike one treacherous blow. Nothing, however, was
said or done publicly. The faithful were warned to watch well, and
a few judicious inquiries brought the whole story out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Commission had been despatched to sit at Singapore,
on the conduct of the Rajah. Gapur was well aware that
the British Government was indisposed to support the
Rajah, and that there existed a body of opinion in England
distinctly and bitterly hostile to him, and certain to
apologise for any insurrectionary movement made to depose
him, even if it involved, as Gapur supposed, his being
massacred along with his English officers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. St. John goes on to say that upon his return to Kuching
the Rajah intended to bring the Patinggi to justice for
this contemplated act of treachery; but this was not done
immediately. Before publicly convicting and punishing
the leading chief of the State, amongst whose relations the
Rajah could count so many staunch friends, it was thought
advisable to wait for some overt act which would afford
clear and convincing proof to all of the Datu's treachery.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>The Rajah had not long to wait. Towards the close
of June he appointed chiefs over the various kampongs
(districts) in Kuching, each to be responsible for the good
order of his kampong, and with power to arrest evil-doers.
These chiefs had been given their commissions publicly in
Court; however, the Datu Patinggi promptly summoned
them to his house, exacted the surrender of their commissions
into his hands, and dismissed them with the remark that he
was not going to allow everybody to be made a datu. This
was open and public defiance, and the Rajah then determined
to disgrace him publicly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Measures were taken to prevent even a show of resistance
being made. Though Gapur was head of the party that
existed in favour of Bruni, and of a restoration to the old
condition of affairs, yet in Kuching he had but few
adherents upon whom he could safely rely, even amongst
his own people; but Malays when forced into a corner often
resort to desperate deeds of folly, and it was to guard
against such an act that precautions were taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a letter the Rajah describes both Gapur and what
his proceedings were:—</p>

<p class='c013'>As he got rich there was no keeping him straight. His abuse
of power, his oppression of the people, his revival of ancient evils,
his pretensions, his intrigues, and his free use of my name for
purposes of his own, had been often checked but never abandoned,
and ever recurring. Some time ago he was seriously warned, and
made to disgorge some of his ill-gotten wealth; but this, instead of
preventing him, only urged him forward, and he not only intrigued
against the Government, but by threatening the better class of
Sarawak people, thwarted our measures, and used language which
was treasonable against every constituted authority.</p>

<p class='c013'>I resolved, therefore, at once to degrade him from his office, so
as to crush the seeds of discontent in the bud. I ordered a great
public meeting of the country for an important business, but, excepting
Captain Brooke, St. John, the Datu Bandar, Datu Temanggong,
and a few others, no one in the country knew my object. The
court was crowded, many hundreds being present. I gently explained
the duty of the people towards the Government. I alluded
to the past, the present happiness of all classes, and the crime
committed by any one who failed in obedience to constituted
authority, or desired to disturb the public peace. I pointed out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>to the elders of the Kampongs that, having received authority from
the Government, they should not have yielded it to the Patinggi,
but at the same time I acquitted them of all evil intention, and
declared—which was strictly true—that I knew their attachment
to the Government.</p>

<p class='c013'>I then turned to the Patinggi, I reminded him of the past, the
warnings he had received and neglected. I detailed the charges
against him, and concluded by saying, "I accuse you before the
people of treason, and I give you the option of publicly declaring
your submission to the Government or of death." He submitted.
I then said, "I do not seek your life, for you are the Bandar's
brother,<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c011'><sup>[228]</sup></a> and have many relatives my friends. I do not confiscate
your property, for your wives and children have not shared your
offence. For the safety of the Kingdom I order you to sit in your
place in this court, whilst proper persons bring to the fort all the
arms and ammunition which belong to you." He sat quiet. I
requested his relatives to go and bring the guns and powder, and,
after a couple of hours, the things were brought. I then shook
hands with the culprit, told him what I had done was for the good
of the people, and that he should hear further from me through the
proper channel. He then returned to his house.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was still a difficulty to be overcome, how to get
rid of him. The Rajah bethought himself of proposing a
pilgrimage to Mecca, and Gapur jumped at it. This would
remove him from Sarawak for some time, and, before his
return, it was hoped his influence would be broken, and his
opportunities of doing mischief be removed, through his
position being given to his brother-in-law, the Datu Bandar.<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c011'><sup>[229]</sup></a>
The Bandar's brother was made the Imaum, the head of the
Muhammadan priesthood, and was added to the list of the
Rajah's trusted councillors. He remained true and a mainstay
to English influence among the Malays in subsequent
difficult times.<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c011'><sup>[230]</sup></a> As to Gapur, on his return in 1856 from
Mecca, now a Haji, he was repudiated by his relations, who
refused to be responsible for his conduct, so that he had to
be banished to Malacca. We shall hear of him again, but
for the moment must look at the proceedings of the Sherip
Masahor, whose brother had married the daughter of Gapur.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>Muka was then a town of considerable importance, at
the mouth of the river of that name. It has since increased
considerably, and is now as large as Bruni. Then, as
now, it had a great trade in raw sago, which is shipped
to Kuching, where it is converted into sago flour in the
Chinese factories, in which form it passes to Singapore.
Oya comes next in importance, then Bintulu, and then
Matu and Bruit. These places supply more than half the
world's consumption of sago. The trade in this had always
been the principal one of Kuching until a few years ago,
when pepper took the first place, but the sago trade is still
increasing.</p>

<p class='c000'>For years past numerous trading vessels from Kuching
visited Muka to obtain this article of commerce, but in
1854 much difficulty had been felt in getting it, as at that
time civil war was raging, and anarchy existed in Muka, so
that trading vessels were debarred from entering the river,
being liable to plunder by one party or the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pangiran Ersat had been placed there in authority
by the Sultan, and he had oppressed the people incessantly.
But beside him there was the Pangiran Matusin, his cousin,
also of royal blood, who had been brought up among the
Muka people, where he had many relations through his
mother, who was of inferior class. A feud had long existed
between these two Pangirans, both of whose houses were
fortified. Ersat had expelled his cousin from Muka, but the
latter had been allowed by the Sultan to return.</p>

<p class='c000'>Matusin, though unprincipled himself,<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c011'><sup>[231]</sup></a> could not countenance
the extortions of the other, and he supported his own
people against the injustice of his rival.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>On one occasion, as Matusin was returning home from
the river mouth, he passed the abode of Ersat, when this
latter, with his followers and relatives, mocked him from
the platform in front of the long house, brandishing their
spears and daring him to attack them. Matusin was filled
with rage. Of all things that a Malay can least endure
is insult. Seizing his arms, he rushed into the house,
and, running amuck, cut down Ersat himself, and, in the
promiscuous onslaught that followed, killed one of the
Pangiran's daughters and wounded another. He then made
his way forth, no one daring to oppose him, as he was a
man of prodigious strength. On reaching his house, he
strengthened the fortifications and prepared for an attack.
In the course of a month, a large force had assembled in
Muka to avenge the death of Pangiran Ersat, led by the
Sherip Masahor, who had called out the Saribas Dayaks,
under the jurisdiction of the Rajah of Sarawak, as well as
the Kanowit Dayaks on the Rejang. They numbered more
than a thousand, exclusive of Malays.</p>

<p class='c000'>This host surrounded the fortified house of Matusin, and
Masahor, in the name of the Rajah, called upon the former
to surrender. He undertook, if Matusin and his followers
would come forth, with all the women and children, and
give themselves up, that their lives would not only be spared,
but that thenceforth they should all dwell together in amity.
It was agreed that this was to take place on the following
morning. But during the night a member of Masahor's
party managed to get into the house of Matusin to warn
him that treachery was intended, and to urge him to escape.
This Matusin did in the dark, attended by six men only;
he fled up country, and made his way to Kuching, where he
threw himself on the protection of the Rajah. Next day
Sherip Masahor, with his ruffians, took most who remained
in Matusin's house, and many of the relations of the Muka
chiefs who had supported him, to the number of forty-five,
chiefly women, massacred every one, and gave their heads to
his Saribas and Kanowit followers. As soon as the news
reached Kuching, the Tuan Muda was sent to Muka to
inquire into matters. He says: "The scene where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>murders took place was then fresh with the marks of the
slaughtered wretches. Their torn clothes, the traces of blood
and tracks of feet, were plainly visible on the ground. In
pulling up through the Muka village, most of the houses
were burnt down, and the graveyards pillaged by Dayaks."
Melanaus adorn their dead with costly gold ornaments, which
are buried with the bodies; this the Dayaks knew; to
attain these and the heads of the dead were their object in
desecrating the graves.</p>

<p class='c000'>The people had lost their favourite leader and relative,
Pangiran Matusin; besides relations they had lost their
homes and property, burnt and pillaged by Masahor's
followers on the ground that the owners had favoured the
slayer of Pangiran Ersat, and they were well aware that
they themselves were doomed, and all would most surely
have been put to death but for the arrival of the Tuan Muda.
And now the poor creatures surrounded him, and implored
that an Englishman might be sent to govern the place,
and deliver them from the tyranny of the Bruni officials.
Having seen to the safety of Matusin's wife and children,
who, with other surviving relations and followers, were sent
to Kuching, the Tuan Muda returned to Sekrang. A fine
was imposed on Sherip Masahor, and he was forced to
release 100 captives, and was deposed from his governorship
for having called out the Saribas under Sarawak rule for warlike
purposes. He was in league with the piratical party in
the Saribas, and not only supplied them with salt, which is an
absolute necessity to a Dayak, and which it was now difficult
to obtain on the Sarawak side, where the markets were closed
to them, but also with ammunition, and in other ways
encouraged them in their opposition to the Government. He
left Serikei immediately, fearing further consequences.</p>

<p class='c000'>A party of malcontent Saribas Dayaks had been induced
by the Sherip to settle in the Serikei river, to be handy agents
for the execution of his oppressive exactions, and the intrepid
Penglima Seman was sent by the Rajah to drive them out.
This he did very effectually, and destroyed their houses and
stores. Shortly afterwards the Datu Temanggong and the
Datu Imaum dispersed a flotilla of some forty Saribas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>bangkongs which they had met in the main river below
Serikei.</p>

<p class='c000'>The unsatisfactory condition of affairs in the Muka and
adjacent districts led the Rajah to pay another visit to Bruni,
and thither he sailed in June, 1855, after having despatched
the Tuan Muda to Muka. He went up in his little gunboat,
the <em>Jolly Bachelor</em>, alone, and with no retinue, no
longer holding high offices under the Crown, "the castaway
of his own country." But he was most cordially received,
and entertained with due honours by the Sultan, by the
Rajahs of both the hostile factions, and by the people. All
saw in the Rajah the possible instrument to relieve them of
the dissensions with which Bruni was troubled, and which
now verged upon civil war. Of the opposing factions, which
had existed ever since the days of Pangiran Usop, one party,
and by far the most powerful, was led by the Pangiran Anak
Hasim, the late Sultan's reputed son (who became Sultan in
1885), and this party was in opposition to the Sultan, who
had lost the support of nearly all his people by becoming the
tool of his cunning and grasping minister, Pangiran Makota.
"Trade had become a monopoly and thus been extinguished;
the exactions on the coast to the northward had produced
dissatisfaction and rebellion; the unfortunate people of
Limbang, which country is the granary of Bruni, was
reduced to extremity, cruelly plundered by Makota and his
sons, and attacked by the Kayans, sometimes at the instigation
of Makota, sometimes on their own account; in short, what
Sarawak was formerly, Bruni was now fast becoming; and
when I pulled into the city in my little gunboat of thirty-five
tons, four of the Kampongs had their guns loaded and
pointed against each other." Such was the unhappy condition
of the country as described by the Rajah.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day after his coming the rival parties disarmed their
fortifications. The Sultan and the Rajahs placed the
government in his hands, with a request that he would
endeavour to establish it on a proper and firm basis, and
promised obedience to all his directions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Makota was absent, having been ordered by the Sultan
to Muka to look into matters there, which meant that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>had been sent to plunder the people of that and the
neighbouring districts, but, though it angered the Rajah, it
rendered his task the easier.</p>

<p class='c000'>Makota was now the sole minister, and the Rajah arranged
that the old executive system should be restored so as to
counterbalance his influence. The offices of the four
ministers of State, or wazirs, established by the ninth Sultan
Hasan, early in the seventeenth century, were revived;
these were the Temanggong, the Bandahara, the di Gedong,
and the Pemancha. Though of ancient origin, by the
will of autocratic Sultans they had been in abeyance
for many years, and their revival gave confidence to nobles
and people alike. They were never allowed again to lapse.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the above-mentioned functionaries, there are
eight ministers of the second class, all nobles; and lastly, a
council of twelve officers of state, chosen from among the
leading people, the chiefs of the different divisions or
parishes of the city. These chiefs being elected by the
people renders this council representative.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pangiran Anak Hasim became the Pangiran Temanggong.
Though stern, he was popular, governed well and fairly, and
encouraged trade. His only brother, the other doubtful son
of Sultan Omar Ali, was made the Pamancha. Now that the
Rajah had succeeded in reconciling the hostile factions, he
trusted that the Pangiran Temanggong, with the assistance
of the other wazirs, supported by his own pledge to uphold
them, with force if necessary, against all disturbers of peace,
would be able to preserve the Sultan from the evil influence of
Makota; indeed the Sultan had a desire to act rightly, and
his disposition was not altogether bad, but avariciousness
was his failing, and the means by which his evil counsellors
gained his ear.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah was pressed to take up his residence in Bruni,
and, could he have done so, all might have gone well, but
he could not hope that his present intervention would
do more than postpone the downfall of the worn-out and
vicious Government, for the elements of discord and decay
were rife. And directly his back was turned the Sultan
failed him. He set aside the advice of his wazirs, and, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>gratify his greed, upheld Makota. He had promised that
this man should be recalled from Muka, but, instead of doing
so, gave him a free hand to deal with the wretched people as
he pleased—to plunder for both himself and his master.
The Rajah then determined himself "to manage Makota,
and to leave the Sultan to rue his own folly"; the two
factions in Bruni he trusted "would join together to resist
oppression, or, at any rate, forbear with each other."</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in 1856, the Tuan Muda went with a force from
Kuching to erect a fort at Serikei, now deserted by Masahor,
and half burnt down by the Dayaks. This was soon built,
and an Englishman was placed in charge, who was shortly
afterwards replaced by Mr. Fox. The Dayaks around were
numerous and hostile. The Tuan Muda found that "in all
directions around Serikei and Kanowit there were enemies."
Some few came to trade, but refused to pay revenue or obey
the orders of the officials. They lived in independence, and
the two branches of Dayak employment were simply heads
and salt. "As these two requirements could not be found
in the same quarter, they in former times usually made peace
with one petty Malay chief for the purpose of obtaining salt,
while the heads were brought from some other petty Malay
chief's village lying in another direction. By this means
the Malays obtained a trade with Dayaks as well as a
following."</p>

<p class='c000'>The imposition of a fine on Masahor and the erection of
a fort at Serikei may have been regarded as an infringement
of the rights of the Sultan. There existed, however, an
understanding between the Sultan and the Rajah in respect
to the Rejang, the main object of which was, so far as the
former was concerned, that the sago districts should be
protected from the ravages of the Rejang Dayaks. The
Sultan Mumin, a poor, feeble creature, was totally incapable
of keeping these unruly subjects of his in check, and the
Rajah undertook to do it for him. It, of course, followed
that the Rajah had authority over, and a right to punish,
these people. Kanowit fort and then Serikei were erected
to keep the Dayaks and Sherip Masahor in check. All that
was done was done in the mutual interests of Bruni and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Sarawak, and at the sole expense of the latter, for the Rejang
in those days yielded no revenue.</p>

<p class='c000'>The house of Ucalegon was in flames, and the fire would
extend to Sarawak, unless it were extinguished by Sarawak
hands, for their own protection.</p>

<p class='c000'>Muka and Oya, where Pangiran Nipa had succeeded
his father, Pangiran Ersat, in power, being still in a very
distracted condition, and the Rajah, now being free of the
troubles that had shaken the very foundations of his own
Government, and which had unavoidably withdrawn his
attention from these places, determined to make another
effort to establish order there in the interests of the suffering
population, and of the important trade between those places
and Sarawak, which had now almost ceased. For this
purpose he again proceeded to Bruni in September, 1857,
and obtained full power to act at Muka, and authority to
intervene was granted him. At Muka the Rajah called
together into his presence the rival factions which had been
murdering each other, and disturbing the trade for the last
four years. There were four hundred persons present, including
the Pangirans Matusin and Nipa, besides the chiefs of
the country, whose relatives had been put to death by Sherip
Masahor. The <em>chaps</em><a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c011'><sup>[232]</sup></a>—the Sultan's mandates—were read,
ordering peace, and authorising the Rajah to punish any
breach of it. The Rajah then spoke to the people, pointing
out the advantage of peace, and pledging himself to punish
any persons who by their actions should disturb it. This
visit of the Rajah was attended with good results, and Muka
enjoyed rest for a brief period.</p>

<p class='c000'>In October, the Rajah proceeded to England, leaving the
government in the hands of the Tuan Besar; upon this visit,
which was of necessity a prolonged one, owing to the complete
breakdown of his health, we will touch later.</p>

<p class='c000'>The month following the Rajah's departure, Pangiran
Makota was violently removed from the scene of his life's
iniquities. We have already recorded the manner of his
well-merited death.<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c011'><sup>[233]</sup></a> Of him the Rajah wrote, "A greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>villain it would be impossible to conceive, with heart blacker,
head more cunning, and passions more unrestrained. I say
this deliberately of a dead man." A fitting epitaph.</p>

<p class='c000'>In December, Mrs. Brooke died, and the Tuan Besar left
for England early in 1859. Upon the Tuan Muda now fell
the burden of the government at perhaps the most critical
period in the history of the raj. Plot was heaped upon
plot, and deceit and treachery faced him on all sides, but
by his courage, untiring energy, and determination the
State was successfully piloted through these grave troubles,
its enemies dispersed, and confidence restored to a panic-stricken
people.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two years previously, Sherip Masahor and the Datu
Patinggi Haji Gapur, now known as the Datu Haji, had been
pardoned. The former had been allowed to return to Serikei,
and the latter to live in retirement at Kuching. It was a
mistaken and highly imprudent policy, for neither had
forgotten his humiliation, and both commenced active intrigue
against the Government; and the party of pangirans at Bruni,
hostile to all reforms, were privy to these plots, of which the
Sultan himself was aware, and at which he probably connived.
Constant intercourse was being kept up between the Sultans
of Bruni and Sambas, which could omen no good to Sarawak;
and Bruni alone, now once more relapsed into its former evil
condition, was without the means of open aggression.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1859, the Europeans in Sarawak were startled by a
report of the wholesale massacre of Europeans, men, women,
and children, at Banjermasin, succeeded by further reports
that all white men were being killed in the other Dutch
settlements, and that the same fate was to be meted out to
those in Sarawak and Labuan.</p>

<p class='c000'>In March, the Tuan Muda, owing to disquieting rumours
having reached him, resolved upon making a tour to the
different stations on the coast, and first visited the Rejang.
At Serikei he was joined by Mr. Fox, and then proceeded
to Kanowit, a hundred miles up the broad Rejang river.
The village and fort together formed a picturesque piece
of irregularity and dilapidation. Here were settled a few
Malays, a gang of cut-throats who lived by swindling the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>Dayaks, and stood by the fort as their only means of security.
Some few Chinese traders had ventured to settle in the place,
but they were a mob of rapscallions. Above the village was
the mouth of the Kanowit river, and on the opposite bank
of this river was the large village of the Kanowit tribe,
adherents of Sherip Masahor. The Kanowit, as well as the
Poi and Ngmah, two branches of the main river above
Kanowit, was inhabited by Sea-Dayaks from the Batang
Lupar and Saribas, unfriendly to the Government. Mr.
Steele had been in charge of Kanowit for eight years. It
was a vastly solitary place for an Englishman during the
north-east monsoon. For three or four months of the year
no communication was to be had with Kuching, owing to the
strong freshes and heavy seas on the coast; but Mr. Steele
had grown so accustomed to the life that he would not have
exchanged it for another. The fort had been often attempted
both secretly and openly, people close around had been killed,
and Mr. Steele had met with several narrow escapes. His
fortmen were not of the best class, but they were of his own
selection. The Tuan Muda felt uneasy about the place.
"There was too smooth an appearance, without any substantial
base." There were no reliable Malay chiefs; and
he left Mr. Fox to support Mr. Steele.</p>

<p class='c000'>On his return to Serikei, the Tuan Muda received letters
from the Sarawak traders at Muka saying that it was useless
their attempting to procure sago there, as the country
was in commotion, war being carried on between Pangiran
Matusin and Pangiran Nipa, and they entreated his support
and aid; otherwise the trade must be stopped. Not only so,
but the Sarawak flag had been fired on by a badly-disposed
pangiran. This was an insult that could not be passed
over, and the Tuan Muda at once proceeded to Muka in the
<em>Jolly Bachelor</em>. As he passed Igan, the Sherip Masahor, who
had a residence there also, pushed off and asked leave to
join him. His object was not obvious, but he protested
sincere friendship, and a desire to see trade re-established.</p>

<p class='c000'>On reaching Muka it was found that the place was in a
most disturbed state, and that everybody was armed. A
demand was at once made that Pangiran Serail, who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>fired on the Sarawak flag, should be fined, and to this the
Pangiran Nipa consented.</p>

<p class='c013'>Towards the close of the day, a message came from Pangiran
Matusin begging me to proceed to his assistance as soon as possible,
as that night there was some probability of Nipa's party taking his
fortification, which was defended by twenty-six men only against
about six hundred, who had built movable stockades all around,
and were gradually closing on him each night, and were now within
about fourteen yards of his house. We warped up and arrived
late at night, and let go our anchor off Matusin's landing-place.
It was the 27th night of the Mahomedan fast month, and the place
being brilliantly illuminated, blazed out as strange a looking pile of
fortifications and habitations as it has ever fallen to my lot to
witness. Matusin came aboard and showed his gratitude more by
manner than by words. He was thin and haggard, and said, "Tuan,
I thought I should have been a dead man to-night, as they intended
adding to the illumination by the blaze of my house, but I did not
fear death, and would never have run away."</p>

<p class='c000'>On the first appearance of light we were all up, and ready to
proceed to work, in order to have the business over as soon as
possible. Our gunboat's deck was crowded with armed men, and
the bulwarks were closed in around by oars and logwood. The
first step we took was to dislodge a floating battery, placed so as to
guard Matusin's landing. After destroying this I sent a party to
pull down the other stockades, numbering some twenty-five of all
shapes and sizes. Pangiran Matusin's fort was being pulled down
also, and before mid-day there was a clearance and change in the
aspect of affairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Excuses were then made for the payment of the fine.
The gunboat was promptly hauled up in front of Pangiran
Nipa's house, "and the muzzle of our 6-pounder was looking
upwards loaded and primed. It would have been close
quarters if we had played with firearms, as we could jump
from the deck to the banks." The Sherip Masahor was with
the Tuan Muda, and professed the most ardent friendship and
desire to assist. The fine was soon paid, and after seeing
Pangiran Matusin safely on his way to Kuching the Tuan
Muda left for Saribas.</p>

<p class='c000'>Trade with Muka during the remaining months of the
year was brisk; matters there settled down quietly; and
Pangiran Nipa kept up a friendly correspondence with the
Tuan Muda.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>The Pangiran Serail, who had been fined, was an envoy
of the Sultan Mumin; he returned to Bruni, gave a plausible
account of his conduct, and loudly complained of the
conduct of the Tuan Muda. The Sultan was irritated, and
Mr. St. John, who was now British Consul-General at Bruni,
heard only Serail's story, and considered the proceedings
high-handed and reprehensible. He afterwards expressed
his opinion that it was so to both the Tuan Muda and to
the Rajah. Thereupon the latter ordered the fine to be
paid over to the Sultan "as a peace offering."</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Spenser St. John, in his <cite>Life of Rajah Brooke</cite>, speaks
of the interference in Muka in 1858 and 1859 as unjustifiable,
but we have already shown that the Rajah had
received full authority from the Sultan to act in Muka, and
what was done was entirely in the cause of peace and order,
though Sir Spenser does not question the motives.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the following June, when on a visit to Sekrang, the
startling news was brought to the Tuan Muda that Steele
and Fox had been killed, and that Kanowit was in the
hands of enemies and murderers. It was the first stroke of
a foul conspiracy, which had as its objects the extermination
of all the Europeans and the overthrow of the Government.
But it had been struck too soon. The aim of the conspirators,
"deep and subtle as men or devils could be," was
to strike simultaneous blows in Kuching and the out-stations,
and this premature action of Sherip Masahor's party before
the Datu Haji Gapur, Bandar Kasim, and other conspirators
were prepared to act led to the original scheme being
broken up into disconnected action. This to some extent
lessened the difficulties with which the Tuan Muda found
himself confronted. As yet he could but conjecture as to
the compass of the conspiracy, and could only suspect the
conspirators, but he was on his guard, and he prepared for
the worst.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few words may be said here with regard to the
situation generally, and the attitude of the population.
From Muka, the Sherip Masahor, the friend and connection
of Pangiran Nipa, could look for strong support. In the
Rejang he had on his side the Kanowits, the Banyoks, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>the Segalangs, the last a hot-headed and treacherous people,
who had always been the Sherip's most active partisans, and
were afterwards his only sympathists; upon the Dayaks it
was naturally thought he could count, but, as regards those
of the Kanowit, events proved this to be a mistake; amongst
the Melanaus of the delta he had a strong following at Igan,
Matu, and Bruit, but not at the other villages; and the
Malays of Serikei feared and obeyed him, though from
their chiefs downwards they hated him. The Kalaka
Malays, under a bad leader, were very doubtful. Those in
Saribas were held in check by the Dayaks, who had been
converted by the Tuan Muda from stout enemies into
staunch friends; the Sea-Dayaks generally were as true as
steel to their white chief, though some were led astray. The
Sekrang Malays were faithful, but the Lingga Malays had
allowed themselves to be awed by letters that had been sent
them by the conspirators, calling upon them to assist in killing
the English or to expect the consequences. Though they
received these letters they made no response to the overtures,
and were at heart with the Government. Sadong, where
there had been no English officer for some time, was, under
the Bandar Kasim, a hotbed of anarchy, and here were the
Datu Haji's principal adherents, as also were the Land-Dayaks
of Lundu.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Kuching and its neighbourhood the Malays were as
usual loyal, from their Datus, the Bandar, Imaum (whose
sister the Datu Haji had married) and the old fighting
Temanggong downwards. Here the Datu Haji had a small
clique only, but men's minds were becoming disturbed by
the baneful rumours that were being sedulously spread
about of the impending downfall of the Government. It
was brought home to their minds, and insisted on, that the
Rajah had forfeited the confidence of the British Government,
which was prepared to leave him to his fate. No
more men-of-war had been sent to Sarawak, and no help
had been offered the Rajah for the suppression of the
Chinese insurrection; all this exercised a bad influence on
some who wavered, though at heart loyal, and it discouraged
the faint-hearted, just as it encouraged hopes in the disaffected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Malay chiefs and the Sherips that they might
recover their lost supremacy. Any signal reverse to the
Government, or any indecision shown by it, would have
produced the gravest consequences, which must have
resulted, however the issue went, in the ruin of the country.
The crisis was critical, and without a strong man at the
helm, disaster would have followed—a leader to counterbalance
the influence of the conspirators—a leader for the
loyal to rally around and to inspire the timid, was wanted,
and was at hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon receiving news of the disaster at Kanowit, after
having despatched an express to Mr. Watson in Saribas to be
strictly on his guard, the Tuan Muda at once proceeded to
Kuching. There an assembly of all the chiefs and head men
was held, and to them, with a sword in front of him, he
declared his stern resolution that there should be no haven
for the murderers of his officers and friends. Before he left
Kuching, Abang Ali, of Serikei,<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c011'><sup>[234]</sup></a> had arrived direct from
Kanowit; he reported the whole place to be burnt down and
deserted, and that the murderers had left; and he was able
to give a full account of the tragedy.</p>

<p class='c000'>One afternoon, as Mr. Fox was superintending the
digging of a ditch, and Mr. Steele was walking about inside
the fort, both unarmed, they were attacked, Steele by two
men, Abi and Talip, whom he had known and trusted, though
their previous characters had been extremely bad. Talip
drew his sword and struck at Steele, but the latter, being an
active man, seized the weapon, whereupon Abi cut him down,
killing him immediately.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same moment a party of Kanowits, led by their
chiefs, Sawing and Sakalai, rushed out of a Chinaman's house,
in which they had been concealed, and killed Mr. Fox.
Sawing and Sakalai struck the first blows, followed by many
others, for his body was terribly mutilated, as was also that of
Steele. They then proceeded to rifle the fort, the garrison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>offering no resistance, except at the commencement, when the
sentry fired and killed one of the murderers.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a stay of a few days in Kuching, organising his
party, the Tuan Muda proceeded with the <em>Sarawak Cross</em><a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c011'><sup>[235]</sup></a>
and <em>Jolly Bachelor</em> to the Rejang river. At Rejang he learnt
from Abang Ali that Tani, the chief of the Banyoks, who, to
cover his tracks, was the first to report the murders to the
Tuan Muda at Sekrang, though not actively participating,
had been a principal speaker inciting to the murders. He
learnt further that Penglima Abi and Talip, two of the actual
assassins, had gone straight to Sherip Masahor, had apprised
him of their deed, and had told him the country was now his
own. The Sherip promptly killed Abi, but Talip escaped
and went to Bruni, where he complained that the Sherip
wanted to kill him to prevent him from telling the white men
that it was his (the Sherip's) order that Fox and Steele should
be put to death. Other conspirators on arriving at Serikei
were also put to death by the Sherip.</p>

<p class='c000'>Abang Ali was at once despatched to Serikei in a fast
boat, the Tuan Muda following in the schooner <em>Sarawak
Cross</em>. He was to put to death all those at Serikei who were
proved to have been guilty of complicity in the murder of Fox
and Steele. He found that the Malays who had been
accessories, under the Penglima Abi, had decamped and
fortified themselves in a creek, there he attacked and slew
them; the few who had remained were seized and krissed.<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c011'><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Tani was caught and executed, though he protested his
innocence, and on being conveyed to death declared solemnly,
"I am not guilty, before long the true culprits will be
discovered." It is perhaps to be regretted that his life was
not spared on condition of revealing the prime movers of the
plot. The case was most carefully investigated by the Tuan
Muda before sentence was passed, and the words he
employed on his way to execution showed that he had a
knowledge of the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. St. John more than hints that Tani was innocent.
But at the time he was not in Sarawak, but at Bruni, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>did not again visit the Rejang. There the justness of the
execution of Tani has never been questioned, even by his
son, Buju, who succeeded him, and he was always spoken of as
one of the most active instigators of the murders. The Malays
who were in charge of the fort were also put to death for
surrendering it without a shred of resistance to the assassins,
and allowing it to be plundered of arms and ammunition,
and everything it contained, and to be set on fire. It was
complicity, and not cowardice; and poor Steele had been
unwise in his selection of fortmen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tuan Muda had brought the Datu Haji Gapur
along with him,<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c011'><sup>[237]</sup></a> not deeming it prudent to leave him in
Kuching unwatched, and now at Serikei the Sherip
Masahor came on board, and expressed his earnest desire to
accompany him up the river, and assist in the pursuit of the
assassins who had fled. He was urgent that his own armed
men should surround the Tuan Muda and act as bodyguard,
but the offer was prudently declined.</p>

<p class='c013'>This man was deeply suspected, but I could not find a clue, or a
tittle of evidence through which he might be brought to trial. I
thought all in this large river were more or less implicated, but we
could not put all to death, though conspiracy was rife. Some were
originators and instigators, some again the active workers; others
merely dupes, and some again only listeners, but none talebearers.
So my course was to meet the Sherip in a friendly manner without
a shadow of suspicion on my brow, and as he sat on one chair, I
sat on another within a foot of him. He had his sword, I had
mine; both had equally sharpened edges.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were also present on deck a guard of armed blunderbuss
men, and the redoubtable old Subu,<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c011'><sup>[238]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>although I beckoned him away, he would take up his seat close to
me, with his gigantic sword at his waist. We sat and talked cordially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>on various topics, and he (the Sherip) particularly recommended every
precaution, as he said he feared badly-disposed men were about.
So after an hour of this hollow friendship we separated, he going on
shore again. What would he not have given for my head!</p>

<p class='c000'>The executions previously done by Masahor had been
to get rid of awkward witnesses to his having been an
instigator of the crime.</p>

<p class='c013'>Something had already been done, but much more yet remained.
My wish was to punish those immediately implicated,
before touching the instigators. I could only get at the former
by the assistance of the latter.</p>

<p class='c013'>I felt apprehensive that I should have difficulties with my own
people after they had witnessed such severe proceedings, but was
determined to carry out my original resolve, and permit nothing to
shake me. I felt, while in this state, no more fear of danger or
death than of washing my hands in the morning. A man with arms
constantly about him, and death staring him in the face, soon loses
the sensation of what people improperly style nervousness. An
express boat was despatched to Kanowit for the remains of our late
friends, and they were buried at Serikei near the fort.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c011'><sup>[239]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Tuan Muda lingered at Serikei as long as he could,
waiting for the Sekrang force, but as there were no signs
of its coming he pushed on to Kanowit, "where there was
nothing to be seen but black desolation. The poles and some
fragments of the old houses were left, but nothing else.
The place looked as if it had been blighted by evil spirits."</p>

<p class='c000'>Here he was informed that the Kanowits and others
under Sawing and Sakalai, two of the principals in the raid
on Kanowit, had retired up the Kabah, a branch stream of
the Rejang a short distance above, and had strongly fortified
themselves there. Hundreds of Dayaks from the Kanowit
river now came and placed themselves at the Tuan Muda's
disposal, but they were his quondam enemies, and were but
doubtful friends. To test their professions of loyalty the
Tuan Muda ordered them to proceed to attack the enemy's
fortification, and should they fail to take it they were to surround
it, so as to prevent the enemy decamping, and to await
his arrival. In the morning they left to execute this order.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two days the Tuan Muda waited for his Sekrang reinforcements,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>whilst the Malays were busy erecting a new fort,
and then a young Dayak chief from the advance party arrived
with the information that they had failed in their attack on
the stockades, and had lost some killed and many wounded,
but they had obeyed the Tuan Muda's instructions, and had
taken up positions out of range all round the enemy's position—they
begged that he would speedily come to their assistance.
They thus proved that their hearts were well inclined; and
these were the people that the Tuan Muda had so severely
punished three years previously.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly early next morning, the Tuan Muda, without
waiting for the reinforcements, started up-stream in the <em>Jolly
Bachelor</em> with a small party, and joined the Dayak force,
which he now felt that he might trust. The Dayaks
willingly took one of the 6-pounders and the ammunition
out of the gunboat, and, leaving her in charge of the Datu
Temanggong, the Tuan Muda marched inland, with a bodyguard
of only forty Malays, and these, though otherwise
trustworthy, not the best kind of warriors. With the exception
of Penglima Seman and Abang Ali he had no reliable
leaders.</p>

<p class='c000'>The enemy's position was reached at 1 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, and it looked
an ugly place to take. The Dayaks had built huts around,
and they now numbered some three thousand. A stockade
was erected 300 yards from the fortification, the gun mounted,
and a summons sent to surrender Sawing, Sakalai, and
others deeply compromised in the murder of Steele and Fox.
This was refused, and the gun opened fire, which was returned,
but the rebels' shot went high and told amongst the Dayaks
in the rear. After forty-five rounds had been fired darkness
set in. The chief, Sawing, had been heard giving directions
right and left. He had previously sent a message to the Tuan
Muda to say that he awaited his arrival and would slaughter
all his followers—the Malays—for he did not regard the
Dayaks as his enemies. And he had reason for this, for
these Dayaks had before been hand-in-glove with the Sherip;
but they had turned, and that at a time when an opportunity
offered of possible retaliation for the punishment formerly
inflicted upon them.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>In the dusk of the evening a few of our party spoke to the enemy,
who had suffered much from our shot, and were, they said, willing
to come to terms. It was now an impossibility, as our force of
Dayaks would be uncontrollable, and I would never receive them
except to hang them all, <em>minus</em> the women and children. I did not
trust much to their hollow words, so despatched a party to bring up
more ammunition in the morning. The night closed in quiet and
tranquil. Next morning, my wish was to interfere so as to save the
women and children, if possible, and I despatched a messenger within
speaking distance of the house, to demand the Government arms and
goods that had been taken from the Kanowit fort. After some time
a few dollars and old muskets were given up; then I sent to tell the
women and children to leave. They replied that they were afraid of
the Dayaks. So, after giving them a certain time, and knowing that
then further delay was useless, I ordered Abang Ali to advance and
take the house if he could. The fellows rushed on, yelling terribly.
I kept our small Malay force together in the stockade with Penglima
Seman, as a panic might arise among them, and the besieged become
desperate, and charge us; so the gun was ready with grape and
canister to be discharged at a moment's notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a furious attack, the stockade was entered, and
there was desperate fighting within between those defending
it and those entering by climbing the poles that sustained it.
Then fire was applied, and both ends of the building kindled
and began to blaze furiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now came the horror of war indeed. Some were burnt, some
killed, some taken prisoners, and some few escaped. So ended that
fortification. Its roof fell with a crash, leaving only its smoking
embers to tell where it had stood. Our Dayaks were mad with
excitement, flying about with heads; many with frightful wounds,
some even mortal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unhappily the leading murderers escaped; they succeeded
in cutting their way through the attacking force. The Tuan
Muda's party suffered heavily, and about thirty-five Dayaks
were killed by poisoned arrows. The puncture shows no
larger than if it had been made by a pin. Drowsiness ensues,
and death follows in half an hour. One of the Malays, who
was thus wounded, was saved by being given a glass of
brandy, and being kept to his feet, walking, in spite of his
entreaties to be allowed to lie down and sleep. Sakalai's wife
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>and some of the women were saved, and were sent to their
friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>After remaining some time at Kanowit to establish confidence
among the Dayaks, and to set a guard in the new
fort, of which Abang Ali was placed in charge, the Tuan
Muda returned to Kuching, stopping on his way at Serikei,
when again Sherip Masahor dissembled, and received him
with marked respect and attention; he subsequently learnt
that this visit was near being his last to any one on earth.
At Kuching the Tuan Muda was welcomed by his countrymen,
the Malays and Chinese, with every honour; what he
had effected had gladdened the hearts of all, but the troubles
were not at an end.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rumours we have mentioned of the massacre of
Europeans in Dutch Borneo had caused extreme disquiet
amongst the natives generally, and the murders of Steele
and Fox led them to believe that the fate wherewith all
Europeans were threatened was to overtake those in
Sarawak as well, and that the Bruni Rajahs were about to
resume possession of the country. Reports calculated to
disturb the minds of the people were diligently spread, and
one, which came from Bruni, was that the Queen of England
was so incensed against the Rajah that she had ordered his
execution, and that his life was spared only by the intervention
of the Sultan.</p>

<p class='c000'>A deep and intricate plot had been formed, the active
principals in Sarawak being the Sherip Masahor, the Datu
Haji, and the Bandar Kasim, and trustworthy intelligence
was subsequently received that they were being backed up
by the Bruni Government, or rather the dominant party
there, by whom an agent had been despatched along the
coast to extort goods from the natives, and to communicate
with the Sherip, to whom a kris was presented with which
the white men in Sarawak were to be put to death. There
was unity of action, moreover, between the conspirators and
their friends in Western or Netherlands Borneo, and of this
the Dutch were aware. They had early intelligence of the
plotting, and warned the Sarawak Government. But the precipitate
action at Kanowit and the subsequent proceedings of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>the Tuan Muda had for a time hindered the conspirators,
and rendered it necessary for them to dissemble, even to the
extent of sacrificing some of their own supporters, which
served a double purpose—to throw off suspicion from themselves,
and to silence dangerous tongues. But within a
short time they were again active, though lack of concerted
action, as in the case of so many other conspiracies designed
to act simultaneously at various points, led to failure, through
too great precipitation of some of the plotters.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Datu Haji was the first to commence. He had
remained at Serikei when the Tuan Muda left that place
on his return from Kanowit, and his object in accompanying
the Tuan Muda there was, while professing loyalty, to
deliberate with the Sherip. On his return to Kuching he
proceeded to Lundu, and there incited the Land-Dayaks to
insurrection, telling them that 2000 white men had already
been killed, and the rest were to be cut off immediately;
he further threatened the Dayaks that if they did not become
Muhammadans they would share the same fate. This story
he had told also to Dayaks in the neighbourhood of Kuching.
A subtle plan was formed to march overland on the town,
and in the dead of night quietly to fire some houses and
then fall on the English, who would be certain to turn out
to help to extinguish the fires, and so would fall easy
victims.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old Datu Temanggong was the first to warn the
Tuan Muda. He went to him, and, after taking the precaution
of ordering all his followers out of the room, told
him to take care of himself, and not to ride and walk about
unarmed. He further observed that many suspicious reports
were flying about. The chiefs were at once assembled,
and were unanimous in recommending that the English
officers should wear arms. "Why do we wear arms?"
they said, "because we cannot trust our neighbours." The
Datu Imaum added that he, being a haji, was not supposed
to wear a sword, and opening his robe showed a hidden kris,
sharp as a razor. The Tuan Muda was aware that it was
useless asking them at this stage to give their authority for
these suspicions; he knew they were not yet prepared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>openly to go further than to warn him to be on his
guard—what had come to their ears would be told him
privately, and in due course of time. Natives are extremely
reticent and cautious at such times. The datus did not
wish to warn foes as well as friends, and were on their
guard against unsuspected spies and babbling tongues.
The warning was rightly regarded, and the Tuan Muda
and his officers prepared to meet the dangers that were
brewing.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few days later the Datu Haji's plot was revealed
to the Tuan Muda, and he acted with promptitude. "I
assembled the chiefs, and acquainted them that I should
turn him out of the country immediately he returned, and
should prepare at once in case any opposition was shown."
The chiefs seemed satisfied, and said they were powerless
with such an old and morose man, and recommended me to
use my own judgment in dealing with him, engaging to
assist me. Guns were loaded, and gunboats fenced in, but
everything was done quietly and without bustle. A guard
was placed in Government House, and the apertures were
barred to prevent sudden rushes. The day after the culprit
returned and was informed that he had to leave the country.
Friendly people were mustered from neighbouring rivers,
and were lounging about in groups, ready at a moment's
notice. All wore arms and work was suspended. Next
morning came, and the Sarawak chiefs assembled the
Nakodas (merchants) and population in the Native Court.<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c011'><sup>[240]</sup></a>
The Bandar addressed them in these curt words: "I follow
the Sarawak Government; there is business to be done.
All those who are disposed to follow and assist me, hold up
their hands." They all responded favourably, and he then
made known, "The Government banishes Datu Haji and
Nakoda Dulah,<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c011'><sup>[241]</sup></a> as they are considered too dangerous to
live amongst us." Some of his relatives conveyed the news
to him, and told the Haji he had to leave the next day; an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>allowance would be granted to him by the Government.
Resistance was useless on his part. So terminated this
affair. He had been condemned in open court and by his
own connections, the Bandar and the Imaum. Although
he had no, or very little, influence in Kuching, he had in
the country, for he was hand-in-glove with the malcontents
amongst the Saribas and Sadong Malays, and was the
cause of the revolt in the Sadong, due to his connection the
Bandar Kasim. He was at once sent to Singapore, not,
however, to remain there for long; and he shortly afterwards
got himself into further and more serious trouble. He had
failed, but he knew others would shortly be active, and he
trusted to them to retrieve his failure, and so prepared to
join them directly they moved. Bayang, the principal chief
of the Dayaks, who had joined him, was imprisoned.</p>

<p class='c000'>The discovery of this conspiracy, the murders of Steele
and Fox, and the knowledge that other plots were certainly
brewing naturally created great alarm amongst the English
residents. No one felt safe, for none knew the actual extent
of these plots, or could distinguish between friend and
foe. The Government Officers were discouraged, for they
felt that the confidence created by long years of labour,
anxiety, and kindly intercourse between themselves and the
natives was fast vanishing. Some of the piratical Dayaks,
who were being slowly but surely weaned from their evil
ways and induced to trade and plant, led astray by cunningly
devised reports, retired again to their fastnesses in the interior
and defied the Government; and it was feared that this
disaffection might spread.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c011'><sup>[242]</sup></a> Sir Spenser St. John writes:—</p>

<p class='c013'>The gentlemen, to a man, stuck to their posts with firmness,<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c011'><sup>[243]</sup></a>
the second class lost all courage; while the Bishop and some of
the missionaries left, the former taking home news that it was a
Mahomedan plot, with the Datu Imaum (the rival Mahomedan
Bishop) at the head of it—whereas the Datu Imaum showed himself,
as ever, the true and faithful friend of the English<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c011'><sup>[244]</sup></a>—</p>
<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>and, we may add, true and faithful he remained for nearly
fifty years afterwards.<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c011'><sup>[245]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The year of anxiety and careful watching closed without
any further outbreaks, but early in 1860 came the final
episode, which ended in the complete dispersion of conspiracies
and conspirators.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was a mad and badly-concerted effort to carry
through the disorganised plot. It was a plot not only to
overthrow the Sarawak Government and murder all the
English, but to massacre the Dutch in Western Borneo
as well. By industriously spreading false reports, Sherip
Masahor prepared the way for a rising of the natives against
their English and Dutch rulers, knowing that if successful
at one point it would become general. He was well aware
how easy it would be to impose upon the ignorant and
sheepish people along the coast, and his bold project was to
despatch thither a specious and clever Bruni rogue, a
runaway of rank from Bruni, named Tunjang, who was to
personate the Pangiran Temanggong, the Prime Minister of
Bruni, and no less a personage than the late Sultan's son,
and the heir to the throne, who had now come from Bruni
to exterminate all Europeans. He was to join the Bandar
Kasim at Sadong, and advance up that river, raising the
people to revolt during his progress, and to follow him.
He was to cross over into Netherlands Borneo, where he
would find many disaffected against their rulers ready to
rally around him, and then proceed down the Kapuas and
attack Pontianak, whither the Datu Haji was to proceed
from Singapore to organise a second branch of the conspiracy,
and to be ready to assist him from within when he
appeared off that place. They were then to return and
attack Kuching from the interior, whilst the Sherip made a
simultaneous attack from the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The relation of events which followed we take from the
Tuan Muda's narrative<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c011'><sup>[246]</sup></a> and from official records.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in January, Pangiran Matusin brought the Tuan
Muda a letter sent him by the impostor, Tunjang, purporting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>to be from the Pangiran Temanggong, ordering him to
proceed to Sadong and there to join this prince, who was
waiting for a numerous force, which was to number many
thousands. The Pangiran, the bearers of the letter had told
him, was exacting and authoritative, and his orders were
being readily obeyed by the people. Matusin supposed that
the Temanggong had really come. The letter was a clever
forgery executed by the Sherip together with others, which
were subsequently sent to the datus and chiefs calling
upon them to assist in exterminating all Europeans. The
Tuan Muda saw in this a dangerous plot, and the hand of
an impostor, and this was the view taken by the members
of council. At once strong parties were despatched to cut
off the evil-doer, whoever he was, and who, false as he
might be, was capable of doing incalculable harm amongst
the simple-minded people up-country, and had therefore to
be dealt with promptly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rightly conjecturing that he might be making for the
Kapuas, the Tuan Muda despatched one party under Mr.
Hay to the head of the Sadong by the Sarawak river to
prevent this, and an express was sent by Sherip Matusain to
warn the Dutch officials. Though Mr. Hay pressed on, he
was too late to intercept this pseudo prince, who had crossed
the border, two days before he arrived, at the head of a strong
following of Malays and Dayaks. In regal style this <em>prince</em>
was borne in a litter, as became one of his exalted rank, and
he now styled himself Sultan. Everywhere he was treated
with marked respect. Men gladly enrolled themselves in
his service, and accorded him the large contributions in goods
and slaves that he exacted. It was arranged that the chiefs
over the border—of Landak, Sanggau, and Pontianak—were
to rise along with their people under his command against the
Dutch; and, indeed, it is probable that many might have done
so, for at Sanggau he was received with salutes and all honours.
But the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</span> of a prince was to be speedily changed for the
more fitting one of a malefactor in chains. The Dutch
acted promptly, and one fine morning he found the place
invested by troops, and the house in which he was staying
surrounded. Some of his supporters appear to have flown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>to his aid, for one pangiran was killed and another wounded—these
were genuine pangirans. The impostor surrendered,
was placed in irons, and conveyed to prison in Batavia; here
he was soon joined by the Datu Haji in the same unhappy
plight. The latter had gone to Pontianak to carry out the
part assigned to him, and had unwittingly run into a trap,
for on landing he was immediately arrested. His departure
from Singapore was known to Mr. Grant, who was then at
that place, and reported by him to the Dutch Consul there,
who immediately telegraphed the news to Batavia.</p>

<p class='c000'>The countries Tunjang had passed through were in a
most unsettled state, and the minds of the people were over-filled
with false reports. Some of the head men were
prepared to live, and, if needs be, die in support of the mock
Temanggong. Sadong was in revolt, and the Bandar
Kasim had sent an open defiance to Kuching. It was
now known that Sherip Masahor was, and had been from
the first, the leading spirit of the conspiracy, and Tunjang
had confessed as much to the Dutch.<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c011'><sup>[247]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Little suspecting the fate that had overtaken his fellow-conspirator
and trusty agent, and deeming that the time
had come for him to perform his part—the third branch
of the conspiracy—Masahor moved on Kuching with a well-selected
mob of his particular desperadoes. But the Tuan
Muda was warned of his approach. The chiefs "earnestly
breathed their anxieties about this individual, saying, 'Do
what you think best for the safety of the country, we are
ready to follow you.' All our guns were loaded and we
never moved without being armed, which gave our friends
great confidence, and the doubtful ones considerable fear."
The Sherip was warned that he would be looked upon as an
enemy and fired upon if he entered Sarawak territory, but
this warning, if received in time, was unheeded. The Tuan
Muda now started with a sufficient force to bring the Sadong
people to their senses, but he had not proceeded far down
the river before he encountered the Sherip advancing towards
Kuching with two large prahus crowded with men. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Sherip was brought up and ordered to turn his boats and
follow the Tuan Muda's flotilla, and this order he dared
not disobey. The Tuan Muda had no time to deal with him
then, unless it had been done summarily, which would have
entailed unnecessary loss of life, so Masahor was escorted
out of the river, and bidden return to his own country:
he was warned not to follow into the Sadong.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Government station in the Sadong is at Semunjan,
about twenty miles up the river. The Malays of this place
were well-disposed. On the Tuan Muda's arrival early
next night he was immediately warned that the Sherip's
sole intention in going to Kuching was to put all the white
men to death, and that he intended to strike at him first,<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c011'><sup>[248]</sup></a>
and a little later came news that the Sherip was anchored in
the river just below. With enemies before him this rendered
the situation critical, for the force with him was not large.
He resolved to deal with the Sherip at once; "he is the
enemy to strike, the rest are mere trifles," was the opinion
of the chiefs with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>No time was lost. The <em>Jolly Bachelor</em> and the prahus at
once silently dropped down the river, and took up positions
around the Sherip's large prahus; fearing the culprit might
escape during the night, the sampans, or canoes, attached to
his prahus were at once taken away.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tuan Muda had only Muhammadan Malays with
him; to them the person of a Sherip, a descendant of the
Prophet, was sacred, and to have him seized and put in irons
was simply impossible. At dawn he called upon those who
did not court destruction to leave the Sherip's prahus, which
several did, and then he opened fire with round shot; so as
to spare life, grapeshot was not used. The Sherip's vessel
was struck about the water-mark, and soon began to fill,
when a breeze springing up, he cut his cables and drifted
ashore, escaping into the jungle with a few followers. The
Tuan Muda's men were reluctant to follow him; some
thought the Sherip invulnerable, others that he had the
power of damping powder and blunting weapons from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>distance, and the search for him was but half-hearted.
Three times the Tuan Muda had raised his rifle and covered
the Sherip as he climbed the bank, but spared him. It is a
pity he was merciful, for wandering down the banks of the
river the Sherip and his followers came across a boat from
which two Malays had landed. The boat they seized, and
in it escaped to Muka—the Malays they wantonly murdered
to cover their tracks. Among other articles found in his
prahu was the Sherip's long execution kris; his bringing this
was significant.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the Tuan Muda returned up the river. At
Semunjan he learnt that the Bandar Kasim had incited the
Malays there to rush the fort whilst he, the Tuan Muda, was
engaged with the Sherip, but they had declined to have
anything to do with him. On arriving at Gadong, then the
principal Malay settlement, the Tuan Muda found that the
Bandar Kasim and his rebellious clique had decamped over
the border. He assembled the now thoroughly cowed people,
and told them they had all been imposed upon by a man,
passing himself off as a Bruni Rajah, and that he did not
blame the lower class people. As Bandar Kasim had
disavowed and challenged the Government the whole of his
property was confiscated, and all his slaves were liberated.
The people were assured by the Tuan Muda that he had no
intention of taking steps to punish their misconduct, though
he plainly told them they should have known better, and he
begged them to be more careful in future. They loudly
upbraided their chiefs for having misled them, and one man
angrily turning to the people, exclaimed, "You are all a
parcel of babies, only fit to crawl, instead of standing upright."
He spoke the truth, but these poor ignorant creatures
had not yet learnt to stand upright. The words of their
chiefs were still law to them, and years of oppression had
taught them to submit without murmur to the rule of the great
over their lives and property. But the spell was broken.
Their chiefs had fled before the Tuan Muda, and the greatest
Sherip in the land had been utterly routed. The agent of the
Bruni Government, whose presence on the coast has been
mentioned, on hearing that the Sherip had been fired upon, left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>his large prahu and fled in fear to Bruni in a small boat,
declaring that he believed the heavens would collapse next.
Shortly afterwards the Bandar Kasim arrived at Kuching with
his whole family, and delivered himself up to the mercy of
the Government.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tuan Muda then proceeded to Sekrang, and there
received a letter from the Malay chief of Serikei, Abang Ali,
urging him to come to their assistance, as Sherip Masahor
had returned, and was again oppressing the people. At
once the Tuan Muda collected a flying force of 150 large
bangkongs, manned by his faithful Dayaks. Serikei was
found to be deserted, and the Sherip had fled to Igan. His
fine house was burnt down. After ascertaining that Kanowit
was safe in the keeping of the people there, the Tuan Muda
proceeded to Igan, the Sherip's actual stronghold, which was
reported to be strongly fortified. This place with the district
around was his own particular property, and was the centre
of his followers, but he had no heart to face the Tuan Muda
again, and fled to Muka. Igan was looted and burnt.
Much of the Sherip's property was seized, including many
long brass guns, or native cannon, of handsome design,
which had been heirlooms in his family for generations,
and some of these now adorn the Court House in
Kuching.</p>

<p class='c000'>The expulsion of Sherip Masahor completed the discomfiture
of the conspirators and their adherents, and brought
their conspiracies to an end. Though lacking unison and
proper disposition these had menaced extreme danger. But
the crisis past left the Government more firmly established
than ever. The Sherips, the Bruni nobles, and the disaffected
Sarawak chiefs now realised that their power to
do harm and to mislead the people was for ever broken.
Dispelled was all existing doubt as to the power of the
Government to endure without extraneous assistance; and
dispelled from the minds of the people was the myth of the
might of the Sultan and his nobles. Confidence was
established in many who were at heart in sympathy with a
Government which brought them justice and security, but
who, doubting its stability as a bulwark against the oppression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>of their chiefs, had been prepared again to resign themselves
to their power.</p>

<p class='c000'>The repression by the Tuan Muda of this last effort of
the supporters of extortion and misrule inaugurated an epoch
of peace and freedom for all time. He had acted with
vigour, and without delay. His resourcefulness and influence
over the people enabled him to tide over a most difficult
time with but poor material, and under the most trying
circumstances. "I will not praise you, for words fall flat
and cold, but you have saved Sarawak, and all owe you a
deep debt of gratitude," were the words in which his uncle
and chief conveyed his deserved appreciation of the services
that had been rendered by him; and he won for himself the
entire trust of the people of all classes, a trust that remains
unimpaired to this day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indifference to the fate of Sarawak had been openly
expressed by the British Government; consequently no
helping hand had been proffered, though the troubles with
which the State was beset were well known. Even the
presence of a man-of-war, though she lent no active support,
would have exercised great moral effect. "Sarawak has
been encouraged and betrayed,"<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c011'><sup>[249]</sup></a> in mournful anger wrote
the Rajah, "England has betrayed us beyond <em>all doubt</em>, and
in the time of urgent peril cares nothing whether we perish
or survive."</p>

<p class='c000'>In April, Captain Brooke, the Tuan Besar, returned to
Sarawak and resumed his duties as head of the Government.
His brother's arrival released the Tuan Muda from his duties
at the capital, and left him free to devote his time to the
more active work yet to be done in the provinces, where his
presence was needed to reassure the people; and there were
still the refractory Dayaks of the Serikei and Nyalong to be
subjected, and Rentap to be smoked out of his lair.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Tunjang's fate is not recorded. The Dutch offered to
deliver him up for punishment, but it was left to them to deal
with him, and no doubt they dealt severely. The Datu Haji
died at Malacca, and Bandar Kasim in Kuching. The
confiscation of his property was deemed sufficient punishment,
but he was not permitted to return to Sadong. The
last phase of Sherip Masahor is recorded in the next
chapter.</p>

<p class='c000'>We will now briefly follow the Rajah's movements in
England, whither he had gone mainly for a rest, which was,
however, denied him. To add to the mental worries caused
by intense desire to safeguard the future of his adopted
country, he was visited by a grave bodily affliction.</p>

<p class='c000'>His reception by Court and by Ministers was more cordial
than on his previous visit to England, and he was publicly
entertained at Liverpool and Manchester, but shortly afterwards
he was struck down by a stroke of paralysis. Though
some months passed before he recovered his bodily strength,
the vigour of his mind remained unimpaired.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his efforts to obtain protection he was backed by
many influential friends, and by public bodies. The
Birmingham Chamber of Commerce memorialised the Government
to restore the protection afforded to Sarawak up to
1851, and a large and influential deputation, representing
the mercantile interests of Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow,
and, to some extent, London, with several members of
Parliament, waited upon Lord Derby with the same object.
Lord Derby's refusal was severely commented upon by the
<cite>Times</cite>, and it occasioned a difference in the Cabinet. The
subject would again have been entertained, had not the
Government shortly afterwards gone out on their Reform
Bill.<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c011'><sup>[250]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah was left with but little hope. He felt that the
Government of both parties desired to be rid of Sarawak,
and that the country was indifferent; moreover he was fully
assured that Sarawak could not stand alone. England
failing, Holland was tried, but "Holland," he writes, "declares
openly that there is an understanding the country shall fall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>to them after my death." Then France was tried; and the
protection of France, the Rajah was of opinion, could have
been gained had the Tuan Besar been whole-hearted in the
negotiations. But the Tuan Besar did not share the Rajah's
opinion that Sarawak could not maintain its independence
unsupported, and disliked the idea of handing the country
over to a Foreign Power, and in this he was supported by
the Tuan Muda. The Rajah wisely gave way to what has
since proved to be the better judgment of his nephews, and he
wrote to the Tuan Muda, "as my views for Sarawak are at
an end, and as we are now to run the risk, with a rational
prospect of success, to sustain the Government I will loyally
and cheerfully work to falsify my own convictions. Time
brings changes, and may work upon the British Government.
But it was a fatal mistake to let slip an opportunity of safety,
recognition, and permanency,<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c011'><sup>[251]</sup></a> and to allow an English prejudice
to interfere with Sarawak. However, it is past, and the
juncture requires union, and united we will cheerily work,"—and
time was very shortly to work on the British Government
in favour of Sarawak.</p>

<p class='c000'>But pecuniary failure was also staring Sarawak in the face.
The Borneo Company, Limited, suffering under severe losses
consequent on the Chinese insurrection and the continued
disturbed state of the country, were losing heart; they
considered it advisable to withdraw from Sarawak, and such
a step on their part would have been fatal to the investment
of further British capital in the country. In the next
place, the Rajah was being pressed for repayment of a large
sum of money, which, for the purposes of the Government, he
had found it necessary to borrow after the ruin caused by the
Chinese insurrection. But "the Borneo Company persevered,
and has long since reaped the benefit of so doing,"<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c011'><sup>[252]</sup></a> and a kind
and ever staunch friend, Miss (afterwards Baroness) Burdett-Coutts,
relieved him of his pressing debt by a loan free of
interest. She further advanced the money to purchase a
steamer, a very urgent need, and the Rajah bought a little
vessel which he named the <em>Rainbow</em>—"the emblem of hope,"
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>and never was a rainbow after a storm more welcome. Of her
the Tuan Muda wrote that "she was welcomed as a god-send
of no ordinary description, whereby communication could be
quickly carried on and outposts relieved or reinforced within
a short time. She was the small piece of iron and machinery
which could carry Sarawak's flag, and raise the name of the
Government in the minds of the people along the coast."</p>

<p>KANOWIT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A testimonial to the Rajah had also been raised by
public subscription "as a simple, earnest, and affectionate
testimony of friends to a noble character and disinterested
services—services which, instead of enriching, had left their
author broken by illness and weariness of heart, with threatening
poverty."<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c011'><sup>[253]</sup></a> With a portion of this fund he purchased
Burrator, a small estate in the parish of Sheepstor, on the fringe
of Dartmoor, in Devon. It was then very much out of the
world, having no station nearer than Plymouth, some miles
off, and the intervening roads were steep, narrow, and bad.
The situation is singularly picturesque; a moorland village,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>with a church of granite under the bold tor that gives its
name to the place. Its wildness and seclusion charmed him,
and there he settled in June, 1859, "trusting to live in
retirement, in peace; but there is no peace for me with
Sarawak in such a state," for the news of the Malay
conspiracies caused him further distress of mind, and he
resolved to return to Sarawak.</p>

In 1856, the
Honourable G.
W. Edwardes had
been appointed
Governor of Labuan;
Mr. Spenser
St. John being
Consul-General at
Bruni. The Governor was known to have imbibed all
the prejudices and antipathies fostered in England by
Mr. Gladstone and his tail; and he was eager in everything
to hamper the development of the little State of
Sarawak. He was not, however, authorised to interfere in
the relations between Bruni and Sarawak, nor in the internal
affairs of these States, where he had no jurisdiction; but
when the Consul-General left on leave early in 1860, the
Consular Office was handed over to him, and he was then
placed in a position to give vent to his bias, and, as Sir
Spenser St. John remarks, "he was delighted to get a chance
of giving a blow to Sarawak." With regard to Sherip Masahor,
"he acted against his better judgment," and with regard to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>subsequent events at Muka "against the strong advice of his
own experienced officers."<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c011'><sup>[254]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Sherip Masahor, after having been driven out of Sarawak,
retired to Muka, and, having established his family and
numerous followers there, passed on to Bruni to lay his case
before the Sultan. Consul-General St. John was then on
the point of leaving, but before his departure he received
information from the Sultan which left little doubt "that
Masahor had instigated the murder of—had, in fact, by his
paid agents, murdered—Messrs. Fox and Steele."<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c011'><sup>[255]</sup></a> On his
way to England Mr. St. John visited Kuching, and there
obtained evidence which quite convinced him of the Sherip's
guilt, and he then wrote to the Sultan, calling upon him to
deliver up the Sherip to the Sarawak Government. But this
letter passing into acting Consul-General Edwardes' hands
was suppressed by him. He had seen the plausible Sherip,
who had been sent to him by the Sultan, and not only
declined to believe in his guilt, but advised the Sultan that
his detention was not justifiable, and that he should be
permitted to return to Muka; there to watch and if needs be
oppose the aggression of the Rajah's nephews. To add fuel
to the flame, he led the Sultan to believe that prosperous
Sarawak would soon be restored to Bruni—a tempting
prospect for the covetous and plundering nobles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Writing to the Tuan Besar, under date July 4, 1860,
Governor Edwardes says:—</p>

<p class='c013'>After careful consideration of the documents sent, and examination
of the case, I am unable to arrive at the conviction that Sherip
Masahor is guilty of instigating the murders of Messrs. Fox and
Steele, or of such complicity to justify me to induce his Highness to
surrender him.</p>

<p class='c013'>His Highness, and the Rajahs, have expressed the most earnest
desire to further the ends of justice, and to afford every assistance to
the Sarawak Government. I have full confidence in their sincerity.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have not hesitated to inform his Highness and the Rajahs that
I consider the evidence insufficient and that he (Sherip Masahor)
could not with justice be surrendered.</p>

<p class='c000'>As regards the Tuan Muda's actions in attacking and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>driving Sherip Masahor out of Sarawak, Mr. Edwardes wrote
that these "have greatly prejudiced the British name and
character in this country, and have engendered a strong feeling
of hostility to this colony (Labuan)."</p>

<p class='c000'>In obedience to instructions the poor Sherip had gone to
Kuching from Serikei, taking certain Government monies and
properties. In the Sarawak river he had met the Tuan
Muda coming down, and he then received orders to follow him
and join in an attack on Sadong. He obeyed, and on
entering the Sadong river brought up and anchored, the Tuan
Muda going on. The same evening the Tuan Muda dropped
down, anchored close to his prahu, sent and <em>borrowed</em> his
small boat, and the next morning unexpectedly fired upon
him. This is the story the Sherip told the Governor at Bruni,
and this is the story the Governor found it suitable to his
purpose to believe, though he <em>hoped</em> it was not true, and that
he would be able "to clear away so great a stain upon the
British name."<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c011'><sup>[256]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The energetic Sherip, before he left Muka had stirred up
his brother-in-law, the sleepy Pangiran Nipa, in charge there,
to reconstruct and strengthen the defences of the place, and
there he was joined by his Igan and Segalang people. No
Sarawak traders were allowed to enter the port to obtain
raw sago, and the Muka people were forbidden to have any
commercial dealings with Kuching. A vessel chartered by
a Madras trader, a British subject, was prohibited under the
heaviest penalties from entering the Sarawak river, and
two of his companions, also British subjects, were detained
as hostages against his doing so. A fleet of twenty-five
Sarawak vessels had been forced to collect at Bruit, permission
having been refused to enter Muka to load sago; and
the sago factories in Kuching were rendered idle.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Bruni two agents had arrived at Muka, the Bandari
Samsu and Makoda Muhammad, whose sole business was
to spread false reports for the purpose of stirring up feelings
of hostility against the English in Sarawak. A spear (the
usual token of a call to arms) had been sent through the Sea-Dayak
countries under Sarawak rule by the Sherip to order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>the Dayaks in the names of the Bruni Rajahs to repair to
Muka, and that would have led to the coast, from Rejang to
Bintulu, under the Sultan's rule, being ravaged by thousands
of Dayaks, and the heads taken of every man, woman, and
child met by them; fortunately, however, the Sarawak
officials were able to keep the Dayaks in.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tuan Muda had received a letter from the Pangiran
Temanggong couched in the most friendly terms, repudiating
the acts of Nipa, and informing him that the Muka river was
to be opened for trade to all alike; but in the meantime the
Bruni Court, always playing a double game, had despatched
the two agents above mentioned, with an order that the
Sarawak nakodas were not to be allowed to fly the Sarawak
flag at Muka, nor to trade directly with the Muka people,
but only through the Bruni Pangirans.</p>

<p class='c000'>Acting upon the Temanggong's assurance, the Sarawak
vessels had gone to Muka, but off the mouth the nakodas
had been warned that they would be fired on if they entered,
and the bearer of a friendly letter from the Tuan Besar to
the Pangiran Nipa was refused admittance. With the aid
of the Temanggong's letter, the Tuan Besar determined to
try by friendly negotiations to get Pangiran Nipa to be
reasonable, and failing that to send the Tuan Muda on to
Bruni to complain to the Sultan.</p>

<p class='c000'>In June, 1860, they anchored off the bar, and a Sambas
Malay, the nakoda of a vessel flying Dutch colours, was commissioned
to take in a letter saying that the Tuan Besar had
come as a friend, and as bearer of a letter from the Pangiran
Temanggong of Bruni, to the effect that Muka was not to be
closed to Sarawak traders. No reply was vouchsafed, and
with telescopes it was observed from the gunboats that earthworks
were being thrown up at the mouth of the river. The
Tuan Besar then decided to take up the message himself,
and two small boats were sent in to sound the bar, upon
which a large war prahu came out and fired at them. This
was a declaration of war, and the Tuan Besar resolved to let
them have what they invoked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following is an account of the affair as given by the
Tuan Muda in his book, <cite>Ten Years in Sarawak</cite>, 1866:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>We plainly perceived that the enemy was preparing in earnest for
opposition. Temporary stockades were being erected at the entrance
and many hundreds of people were collecting heaps of wood in
various places on the shore; these were to be burnt, and their intention
was to raise a strong breeze to drive us from our anchors and
drift us on to the coast. The idea of the effect was correct, that
excess of heat would produce a vacuum, and cause an inshore current
of air. However, their fires were not sufficient, and the expected
effect did not follow.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/p250.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The town of Muka lies about two miles up the river of
the same name, and is situated on both banks of that river
and of another, the Telian, smaller in volume, that here flows
into it. At the mouth was not only the usual bar, the
channel through which had been staked to obstruct the
entrance, but also a long sandy finger of land on the north
side, which at that time deflected the tortuous stream. Behind
the gunboats was a fleet of traders impatient to enter and
obtain their cargoes; for which they were more eager than
for exposure to danger.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>We had received an announcement of a large party among the
enemy being in favour of at once making peaceful overtures; and
even the headman's brother, Pangiran Lada, advised the opening of
their river, and admission of our boats to trade; but the headman
himself, Pangiran Nipa, was firm in the grasp of Sherip Masahor's
mother and sister, who were hostile to any approach to friendly
relations. Many of our people had relatives among the enemy,
some even had wives living in Muka. A council of war was held
on board the <em>Venus</em><a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c011'><sup>[257]</sup></a> in the evening, at which all the chiefs and
Europeans were present. It was decided that an advance should
be made next morning for the entrance to the Muka river. A landing
party was appointed to cut off the narrow point which extends to
the mouth. By landing there and making a demonstration, the
enemy would give up their lower stockade, and the pinnaces might
then have free ingress over the bar and through the narrow channel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tuan Besar took charge of the landing party, which,
however, could not effect much, as it was so small, and a
despatch was sent off to Kuching to hurry up reinforcements.
The Tuan Muda was in command of the little fleet of three
small gunboats.</p>

<p class='c013'>Morning came, and we were on the alert before the sun had
given any signs of approaching the horizon, and within a few minutes
we were gliding along (the Tuan Muda aboard the <em>Venus</em>), with a
light though full breeze steering to the nearest point for crossing the
bar; then we again came to anchor. Our first work was to draw
the spikes, which were soon shaken with bowline knots let down to
their base. We opened a passage wide enough for an entry, and
with one boat in tow we advanced towards the mouth. The sea
was as calm as a pond, and the morning bright without a cloud.
We had crossed over the bar with only six inches under our keel,
and a stake had dragged along under our bottom without doing
injury even to the copper.</p>

<p class='c013'>One boat, commanded by a gallant native, Penglima Seman (who
has so often been mentioned before), was ahead of us, and drawing
towards the enemy's stockades, at which we opened fire directly we
were within range. The enemy soon abandoned this position and
made off up the river as fast as boats would carry them. We then
entered the river, and anchored about half-way between the mouth
and the enemy's fortifications to await further orders, and become
better acquainted with the position of what forts and obstacles they
might have thrown in our way, to allow time also for the remainder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>of our flotilla to join us. We inspected the enemy's fortifications in
the afternoon, and found that they were holding a high and formidable-looking
stockaded house of two stories, the lower having port-holes
for large guns, and the upper pierced with small apertures for
the firing of lelahs (brass ordnance of native manufacture). There
were also small stockades, protected with sacks full of raw sago.</p>

<p class='c013'>The position was well chosen, and had thorough command of a
long reach in the river. A few yards below the fort were two large
booms fastened across the river, with no apparent passage for boats
to pass through.</p>

<p class='c013'>A landing party was despatched in the morning to reconnoitre the
enemy's position, and a temporary enclosure was then thrown up by
our party beyond the range of the enemy's guns, to form a basis for
active operations, from which nearer stockades could be fed and
watched,—</p>

<p class='c000'>that is to say, advanced stockades could be thrown up and
kept supplied with men and ammunition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tuan Besar was at the head of two hundred men,
but on a good many of these no reliance could be placed.
After having established a basis of operations on the spit of
land at the mouth, he was to advance in the direction of the
town. This was done, and as the force approached it was
saluted with fire from the guns in the stockades and houses,
but that did little damage, and the party set to work intrenching
itself. "Nearly the first shot fired entered a
prog-basket and smashed a bottle of gin. A few only
were wounded, and the escape from further casualties was
surprising."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tuan Muda was now resolved on running the
gauntlet past the town, up the river, so as to place it
between himself and the land force under the Tuan Besar,
whose position was in danger. It would be a hazardous as
well as a daring attempt, but he prepared for it in an
ingenious manner, by constructing a stockade round the
<em>Venus</em>. Long beams were placed across the schooner, and
to them a framework was attached horizontally, and upon
this frame a stockade was erected, screening the deck
and the sides to the water's edge, so that the <em>Venus</em> assumed
the appearance of a monstrous "Jack in the Green" or
haystack. The thick planks reached to five feet above the
bulwarks, and were pierced with holes through which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>guns could play on the enemy's fortified houses as the <em>Venus</em>
drifted up-stream with the tide. This took two days to
accomplish. Meanwhile on shore the land party had thrown
up a bank for protection, and further the natives had dug
pits about two feet deep in which they lay after duty, and
were thus completely protected from the enemy's shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>But no progress up the river could be effected till the
booms had been removed, and this would not be an easy
matter, as they were commanded by the forts. It could be
effected only at night, and by expert and daring swimmers.
The Tuan Muda, Pangiran Matusin, and a nakoda, undertook
the task. Under cover of the darkness, in a small
canoe, they stole softly up the bank, unobserved, and then
the pangiran and nakoda entering the water, with their
swords set to work to sever the rattans that held the booms
in place. These rattans had been twisted together to the
thickness of a hawser cable, and had to be cut under water.
It was an anxious time for the Tuan Muda, as any moment
might have brought a volley on their heads.</p>

<p class='c013'>In an hour they were severed. Towards the latter part of the
time, the enemy were on the alert, and one boom moved slightly
with the tide, when a few harmless shots ensued, which we heard
pass over our heads among the leaves. At length the two men
returned, and the enemy cried out, "Our booms are adrift," and
forthwith banged away, but never caught sight of us. Matusin was
so exhausted that I had to assist him into the boat, and at first I
thought he was wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tide was ebbing, and the booms, now disengaged,
floated downwards towards the sea. The passage was clear
for the venture upwards of the <em>Venus</em>. Messrs. Watson
and John Channon accompanied the Tuan Muda, who had a
crew of nine Europeans, besides the Malay complement.</p>

<p class='c000'>On that night the attempt was to be made, anchor to
be raised half an hour before midnight, when the tide was
flowing. Happily the weather favoured, as a thick mist and
drizzling rain set in.</p>

<p class='c013'>We triced up the awnings and up anchor, when the tide
swept us on so swiftly that I soon found it would be hopeless
trying to turn the vessel, so we drifted stern first, with two oars out
on each side to assist in steering. Our guns were loaded and ready,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>and not a voice was to be heard as we silently and swiftly drifted
along. I stood on the top of the stockade to pilot the vessel.
We were soon off the camp (of the land force under the Tuan
Besar), from which I was hailed to look out as the enemy would
fire on us directly. I replied "All right," and then stepped on
deck to be under cover. Just as I was so doing, a shot was fired
from the bank close abreast of us. Another five minutes, and we
were fairly in the fray. I heard the enemy call "Look out, the
pinnace is drifting up," and they blazed on us volley after volley, as
we lay within five or six yards of their fortifications. Watson
watched to fire as the enemy opened their ports, but the haze was
far too dense for us to discern anything at all; I soon found,
however, that we were not progressing, and had fouled something.
We swung to and fro, at times close under the enemy's guns, and
then away into the centre of the stream.</p>

<p class='c013'>We let go our anchor and hauled it up again, but all to
no purpose, and we were at a loss to know what had fouled us.
We then laid out a kedge and hove it home, without moving clear,
and every now and then we blazed our 6-pounder of grape into the
enemy, while they peppered us incessantly. The position was far
from pleasant with guns banging all around and the fog and
smoke so dense as to preclude a possibility of making out our
position. At length I found that a large rattan made fast to one of
the booms which had been cut adrift was holding us. The rattan
was across the river, and the enemy had evidently entertained the
intention of reconstructing their booms that night. I ordered a
plucky young native<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c011'><sup>[258]</sup></a> to jump down and cut it, which he did with
two strokes of his sword. This had been holding us now for more
than two hours under the enemy's fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>Directly the rattan was gone, the schooner swung
sufficiently to bring the guns to bear on a lofty building
whence most of the firing had come, and, after a round of
grape, the wailing of women was heard issuing from it, and
the enemy's fire was silenced. Next morning it was ascertained
that the Pangiran Lada, brother of Pangiran Nipa,
and some of his followers had been killed. The tide was
still flowing, and the <em>Venus</em> drifted on above the town, and
anchor was cast within range of all the houses. Only one
small stockaded place continued to fire on her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Four hours had elapsed since we started; for three we had been
exposed to fire. When we had passed the danger, our men gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>three hearty cheers, which was answered by the party in the camp.
At daylight we found a goodly mess on our decks, shot, pieces of
iron, and nails in bucketfuls; our spars and ropes had been considerably
damaged and cut about. The awnings were riddled with
grape and nails; scarce a square foot had escaped uncut, but only
two men were wounded, one, an Englishman, in the face. The
other was struck in the leg by a splinter; but the barricading of
wood had most effectually saved us all; without it, I don't think
one would have lived to tell the story.</p>

<p class='c013'>After an hour's work, the deck had been cleared, and then we
opened fire upon the enemy's village, or rather on the headman's
house (Pangiran Nipa's), which had guns mounted on the roof.
The women and children had all been taken up a small stream on
which the village is situate.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c011'><sup>[259]</sup></a> The only return was kept up by the
small stockade which had troubled us on the previous night, and
this place must have been guarded by some very determined fellows.</p>

<p class='c013'>The whole country—if only we had an available force with us—was
in our hands. To all appearance the place was deserted,
and it provoked us beyond measure not to be able to take the
initiative. In the course of the afternoon we determined to pull
higher up the river, and take up a position to communicate with
our force at the mouth. We should also be above the enemy's
fortifications, and enabled to receive and support those who were
inclined to favour our cause.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here the Tuan Muda was constrained to remain for
over a month, as was also the Tuan Besar below the town,
waiting for reinforcements from Kuching.</p>

<p class='c000'>Desultory fighting, firing at the forts and from them,
and attempts made to waylay those who passed between the
camp and the <em>Venus</em> occupied the tedious interval, but at
length the desired help came; and those who arrived were
divided between the force under the Tuan Besar, which
would be engaged in a frontal attack on the town, whilst the
other force, under the Tuan Muda, would march inland to
make a flanking movement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Everything being ready, the Tuan Muda started, drawing
with him a 6-pounder gun. The Englishmen of his
party numbered nine. The advance was by no means easy.
The ground was rough and treacherous, full of bog-holes,
and the enemy hovered around, and kept blazing at the
party from every cover.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>"Pangiran Matusin was indefatigable; no weight seemed
too heavy for his powerful limbs to lift, and although a man
of rank, he worked as one of his slaves. At midnight we
fitted our 6-pounder brass gun, and fired one shot to see that
it was ready. The enemy fired all night, and the quantity
of ammunition expended must have been considerable."</p>

<p class='c000'>On the morrow, at daybreak, all preparations were made
for a further advance, when a messenger arrived from the
Tuan Besar ordering the cessation of further hostilities, as
Mr. Edwardes, Governor of Labuan, had arrived off the
mouth of the Muka in the H.E.I.C.'s steamer <em>Victoria</em>, had
peremptorily forbidden them, and had threatened, unless he
were instantly obeyed, that he would fire a broadside upon
the Sarawak camp. He further sent a messenger into Muka
to inform the Pangiran Nipa that he and his were taken
under British protection, and to forbid any more hostilities
whilst the Sarawak forces were withdrawing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The indignation and consternation produced by this
interference can be better imagined than described. The
Tuan Muda was of course obliged to withdraw and descend
the river, jeered at by the enemy at every point, who, regardless
of the orders of the Governor of Labuan, continued to
fire at the party, which fire they did not venture to return.</p>

<p class='c013'>We reached the headquarters shortly after mid-day, and I was
present at a discussion before the Governor, an old and infirm
man, who most doggedly attempted by every means in his power
to bring disgrace on our little State. He expressed himself with
marked favour towards the Sherip Masahor and his followers here,
notwithstanding that they had been the murderers of two Englishmen
only the year before. The Governor held interviews in the
houses of the natives of Muka (our enemies), and reports were
listened to, even credited, of the demands and deceits of the
Sarawak government. None but the most blind and prejudiced
could have entertained a doubt of the absurdity of these assertions,
but the Governor's duty appeared to be a preconcerted business to
disgrace our flag,<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c011'><sup>[260]</sup></a> and to defeat our objects, which were, firstly,
to open trade; secondly, expel Sherip Masahor and his myrmidons,
and establish some creditable government that would enable traders
to hold their property and lives in safety.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>He found fault with the proceedings of Pangiran Matusin,
and was startled when told the man in question was sitting opposite
him. A few papers were immediately produced by the Pangiran
to justify his acts. The signatures of the Rajahs of Bruni were
attached to the documents, and the old Pangiran's quiet, gentle
voice, under as resolute an eye and countenance as could be seen,
softened the Governor's heart towards him.</p>

<p class='c013'>If this untimely interference had not taken place, the country
would have been in our hands in three days.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under protest, and with an intimation that the matter
would be referred to the Foreign Office, the Sarawak force
retired, followed by boatloads of the more peaceful inhabitants,
who entreated not to be left to Sherip Masahor's vengeance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Governor Edwardes informed the Tuan Besar that he
had received power from the <em>Sultan</em> to interfere, and then
called upon him in the name of the <em>Queen</em> to retire from
Muka; he was acting as a minister of Bruni as well as a
British official.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tuan Besar was unwilling to risk a collision.</p>

<p class='c013'>He need not have paid any attention to the Governor's
summons, and it is probable that had he refused to listen to it,
Mr. Edwardes would not have dared to interfere with violence.
But Captain Brooke took the wise course of withdrawing his force
and appealing for justice to the British Government. For this
conciliatory and prudent step he received Lord Russell's thanks.
I will not enlarge on Mr. Edwardes' conduct, but his constant
association with the murderers of his countrymen was very much
commented upon.<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c011'><sup>[261]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Protesting against the action of the Governor "as
seriously affecting British trade and compromising the safety
of British subjects," the Singapore Chamber of Commerce
wrote to Lord John Russell, October 5, that the Governor
was actuated by jealousy of Sarawak, "the interests of that
colony (Labuan) being in some degree opposed to that of
the settlement of Sarawak, the latter having attracted to
it a large trade, part of which might but for the existence of
Sarawak be expected to find its way to Labuan."</p>

<p class='c000'>Before the Tuan Besar left Muka, the Governor, both by
word and in writing, pledged himself not to leave Muka until
all the forts there had been demolished, and he guaranteed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>that trade should be opened, and that all those, both at Muka
and Oya, who had sided with the Sarawak Government
should not in any way be punished. But these were
promises he had no intention to perform, neither had he any
power to do so, for he returned to Labuan the day after the
Tuan Besar had departed, and left Sherip Masahor under
the ægis of the British flag to work his own sweet will on
the people. By a significant coincidence the Sherip's arrival
there had been simultaneous with his own.</p>

<p class='c000'>Furthermore, Mr. Edwardes had brought down with him
a Bruni minister, the Orang Kaya de Gadong, the head of
the Council of Twelve, known as "a consistent opponent of
any intercourse with Christian nations; and when forced by
business to sit and converse with Europeans, the expression
of his face is most offensive, and he was one of the few
natives I have met who appeared to long to insult you.
He was one of the most active of those engaged in the
conspiracy to assassinate the Rajah Muda Hasim, partly on
account of his supposed attachment to the English alliance."<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c011'><sup>[262]</sup></a>
This was the man who was to act as the Sultan's agent,
and when the Governor had left he cruelly vindicated his
authority in the usual Bruni fashion. He levied heavy fines
which he wrung from these poor people, returning to Bruni
with many thousand dollars' worth of property, and taking
with him the names of thirty <em>rebels</em> to be submitted to the
Sultan as deserving of death. But rebels against the
Sultan they were not. They had heard three years before
the Sultan's mandate empowering the Rajah to guard and
guide their affairs, ordering peace, and authorising the Rajah
to punish any breach of it; they had heard the Rajah
pledge himself to punish any who by their actions should
disturb it. Now for forming a party in favour of peace
and order, and for holding themselves aloof from the real
disturbers of peace, they were handed over for punishment
to the latter by a British official. These unfortunate people
could not resist. Resistance was rendered impossible, as the
Orang Kaya and the Sherip had come down backed by a
man-of-war, which represented a power which they well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>knew was far stronger than the Sarawak Government, to
which they would have otherwise looked for help.</p>

<p class='c000'>This, however, was not the only evil caused by the
wanton and capricious act of Governor Edwardes. The
whole country was disturbed. The peaceably disposed were
filled with apprehension, and all the restless and turbulent
Sea-Dayaks encouraged by reports, which, though exaggerated,
were but the natural consequence of the Governor's
action, coupling his name and the Sherip's together as the
real Rajahs of the country, prepared to protect the enemies
of the Sarawak Government with men-of-war. The Sherip's
henchman, Talip, the actual murderer of Steele, led a large
force of Kayans down the Rejang river, attacked the Katibas,
and destroyed fourteen Dayak villages. This was done
because these Dayaks had been staunch to the Tuan Muda
against the Sherip. The Malays at Kanowit were seized with
a panic, and the Tuan Besar seriously entertained the idea of
abandoning the station, which would have meant the sago
districts being again exposed to the raids of the Dayaks.
Sherip Masahor was left at Muka, with all the prestige of
having the Governor on his side, to reorganise his plots, with
tenfold more power to do mischief than before; and just as
confidence had been again established after the late troubles,
the lives of the Europeans were again endangered. The
sago trade was ruined. The Sarawak vessels had to return
empty; the factories in Kuching to suspend work; and the
Singapore schooners to sail without cargoes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst the Tuan Besar returned to the capital to direct
affairs there, the Tuan Muda remained on the coast to
oppose any aggressive action the Sherip and his Bruni
colleagues might conduct against those within the borders,
as also to counteract their growing influence. The Melanaus
of Rejang village, who were not safe where they were, to
the number of 2000, he saw safely moved to Seboyau.
Numbers of Muka, Oya, and Matu people also abandoned
their homes, and shifted into Sarawak territory. The
Kalaka Malays, although in Sarawak territory, were so near
the borders that they did not deem themselves safe, and sent
an urgent message to the Tuan Muda for protection whilst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>they made their preparations for moving. He at once went
to them, remained with them until they were ready, and then
in the <em>Venus</em> escorted them to Lingga. All these wretched
people had to abandon their sago estates and gardens, but
they deemed anything preferable to constant danger to life
and liberty, and to being ground down to supply the rapacity
of the Bruni nobles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fearing that many of their people would be led astray
by the agents of Sherip Masahor, who were now all over
the country withdrawing people from their allegiance to
the Government, the well-disposed Dayak chiefs of the
Kanowit earnestly begged that an English officer should
be stationed there. The Tuan Muda visited Kanowit
without delay, and with the aid of the people built a new
fort in a better position. Having obtained the sincerest
promises from the Dayaks to protect and support him,
the Tuan Muda left young Mr. Cruickshank in charge,
and then returned to Sekrang. Active measures had also
to be taken against a large party of Dayaks in the Saribas
who had fortified themselves in preparation for the coming
of the Sherip, and these were driven out. But the Saribas
Malays were surprisingly staunch. "Enemies were numerous
up the rivers Sekrang, Saribas, Kalaka, Serikei, and Kanowit,
numbering many thousands of families, all of whom relied
on the support of Sherip Masahor,"<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c011'><sup>[263]</sup></a> and these had to be
watched and kept in check by punitive forces despatched in
different directions. The heads of these rivers have one
watershed, and the focus of the malcontented Dayaks
was Rentap's reputed impregnable stronghold on Sadok.
Owing to its situation, almost in the centre of this watershed,
it was at once a support and a refuge to those Dayaks,
and around it they gathered. The powers of the Government
during the past few years had been taxed to their
utmost, so that Rentap of necessity had been left undisturbed,
and with the munitions of war supplied by the
Sherip, and the staunch support of the Kayans his power had
increased. But the Tuan Muda was not to be denied, and
his fall was near.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>In November, 1860, the Rajah left England, and with
him went the Consul-General, Mr. S. St. John, and Mr.
Henry Stuart Johnson<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c011'><sup>[264]</sup></a> to join his uncle's service. After
a short detention in Singapore waiting for the <em>Rainbow</em>, he
arrived at Kuching on February 12, 1861.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Consul-General now officially informed the Council
of Sarawak that the British Government disavowed and
totally disapproved of Governor Edwardes' proceedings.
But though they reprimanded him, they supported him in
office. His term as Governor was, however, very shortly to
expire, but not till he had seen, what must have been gall
and bitterness to his soul, as it certainly was to his backers
in England, the cession by the Sultan to Sarawak of Muka
and all the region of the sago plantations, the produce of
which he had hoped to secure for Labuan, and the banishment
of Sherip Masahor from Borneo.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. St. John went on to Bruni and relieved Mr.
Edwardes of his position as Consul-General, and was the
tactful and just medium for arranging the difficulties produced
by the conduct of the latter. He says:</p>

<p class='c013'>I established myself in the capital, to find the Sultan sulky at
the failure of Mr. Edwardes' promises. I remained quiet for a few
weeks, when I found his Highness gradually coming round, but it
was long ere I was again established first adviser to the Crown, for
Mr. Edwardes' promises had either been great, or had been misunderstood,
and they thought that the British Government was about
to remove the English from Sarawak, and return the country to
them.<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c011'><sup>[265]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In April the Rajah went to Bruni. The Sultan and
the wazirs received him warmly, and the good understanding
between the two countries was established anew. The Sultan
was now anxious to place Muka and the intermediate places
under the Rajah's rule, but the latter waived this consideration
until hostilities were over. The Rajah then went to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>Oya, Mr. St. John accompanying him, also the Sultan's
envoy, Haji Abdul Rahman, bearing private letters and
messages from the Sultan pressing Pangiran Nipa not to
fight. Here the principal chiefs were seen, and the Sultan's
commands that hostilities should cease and that Sherip
Masahor was to be banished were read to them.<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c011'><sup>[266]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. St. John then went to Singapore to obtain a man-of-war
from which to deliver the Sultan's decree at Muka,
and the Rajah made every preparation to assume the
offensive against Muka, as it was not expected that the
Sherip would quietly submit to even the Sultan's mandate.
Masahor had defied both the Sultan and the Bruni Rajahs,
and had heaped insults upon them so often before when in
the plenitude of his power in the Rejang, where he had
been practically an independent prince, with the dreaded
and powerful Kayans and the Dayaks at his back, that his
submission was doubtful. This was no idle supposition, as
one writer has suggested, for when, two months after Mr.
Edwardes' ill-advised action at Muka, the <em>Victoria</em>, conveying
Messrs. A. C. Crookshank and L. V. Helms (of the
Borneo Company), again visited Muka, to endeavour once
more by peaceable means to re-open trade with Kuching,
these gentlemen and the captain, who had foolishly gone up
to the town unarmed and without a guard, met with a hostile
reception on the part of the Sherip, and would have fared
badly at his hands, had not his adherents been prevailed
upon to desist by the wiser counsel of Pangiran Nipa.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. St. John went to Muka in H.M.S. <em>Charybdis</em>, and
with Captain Keane and an armed force of 200 blue-jackets
and marines proceeded up to the town. The Sultan's <em>titah</em>
(decree), "advising a cessation of hostilities, and that Sherip
Masahor and his men were to leave the country," was read,
and both Pangiran Nipa and the Sherip promised obedience.
They were told that Mr. Edwardes' interference had not met
with the approval of her Majesty's Government, and "Captain
Keane's judicious conduct in taking an overpowering force
up the river to the middle of the town showed them that
Mr. Edwardes' support was no longer to be relied upon."<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c011'><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>The Rajah then went to Muka with a large force to
ensure that there should be no resistance, and Muka was
surrendered to him. Pangiran Nipa and the Bruni aristocracy
were sent to Bruni, and Sherip Masahor was deported
to Singapore. The Rajah wrote: "He will never
trouble Sarawak more, and I am not lover enough of bloody
justice to begrudge him his life on that condition. He
deserved death, but he was a murderer for political ends."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah now established himself at Muka, and spent
a month working to bring order into the district, so torn
by civil war and crushed by oppression that everything was
in confusion, and where there had been no protection for either
person or property, and justice had not been administered.
The effect of opening the port was immediate. Numbers of
vessels entered bringing goods from Kuching to traffic with
the natives for raw sago.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in August the Rajah went to Bruni again, and for
the last time. The concession to Sarawak of the coast and
districts from the Rejang to Kedurong point was then
completed. For many years the Sultan had derived little
or no revenue from these parts, for what had been squeezed
out of the natives by the pangirans went to fill their own
pockets, and he was more than satisfied to receive a sum
down and an annual subsidy, which would be paid into his
own hands. And the natives rejoiced, for they were now
freed from the rapacity of these Bruni pangirans.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And thus," says the Tuan Muda, "were about 110
miles of coast annexed to the Sarawak territory—valuable for
the sago forests, but in a most disturbed state, owing to a
prolonged period of the worst anarchy and misgovernment.
Its inhabitants had many redeeming qualities when once
relieved from the Bruni tyranny and oppression, as they were
industrious and clever in different trades, particularly that of
working wood, and the rougher kinds of jungle labour. But
they required a severe hand over them, although one that
was just, and were scarcely able to appreciate kindness.
They had considered it a merit to a certain extent to be the
Sultan's slaves, although they had many times smarted
under the foulest injustice, and been deprived of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>wives and daughters; the majority of the latter class were
often taken for the Bruni Rajahs' harems.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The women were considered better looking than most
others on the coast, having agreeable countenances, with the
dark open rolling eye of Italians. The men are cleanly and
generally well dressed, but not so nice looking as those of
many other tribes."</p>

<p class='c000'>After the Rajah had laid the foundations of good
government, he appointed Mr. Hay as Resident,<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c011'><sup>[268]</sup></a> and in a
few years the aspect of the place, the condition of the
people, and even their character was changed for the better.
A fort had also been planted at Bintulu, then at the extreme
north of the coast now under the sway of the Rajah, and a
Resident appointed there.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sherip Masahor, exiled to the Straits Settlements, lived
the rest of his life in Singapore. He was granted a small
pension by the Sarawak Government, which he eked out by
boat-building, and died in February, 1890. To the end he
continued to intrigue, through his relatives, in Sarawak
affairs, but to no purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was an arch-fiend, and the murderer of many of his
countrymen. He butchered in cold blood the relatives and
followers of Pangiran Matusin; he executed his own trusted
agents in the murder of Fox and Steele to silence their
tongues. One further instance of his cruelty may be
quoted. Jani, a noted Sea-Dayak chief of Kanowit, visited
Sherip Masahor at Muka, and told him that Abang Ali had
sent him to murder him, Masahor, treacherously, which was
absolutely false, and that he revealed the fact to convince
the Sherip of his own loyalty to his person. Masahor bade
him prove his loyalty by attacking the fort at Kanowit.
Jani promised to do this, but asked to be given a head so
that he might not return empty-handed to his people. The
Sherip ordered up a young lad, the adopted son of a Malay
of rank, a follower of the Sarawak Government, whom he
had already mutilated by cutting off his hands, and he bade
Jani then and there decapitate the poor boy and take his
head. This is but one instance of his ruthlessness. Backed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>by his Segalangs he had always been a terror to the Malays
and Melanaus of the Rejang.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah's work was now done. What he had come
out to do had been accomplished, and his failing health led
him to seek peace and repose at his refuge, Burrator. "I
am not strong, and need to be kept going like an old horse,"
he wrote to the Tuan Muda. After publicly installing the
Tuan Besar, Captain Brooke-Brooke, as the Rajah Muda and
his heir, he sailed towards the end of September, leaving the
government with confidence in the hands of his nephews.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shortly after his arrival in England the Rajah received
the good news of the fall of Sadok, and the remaining cause
of anxiety was removed from his mind. "Though confident
of the result, the great difficulty of the undertaking, and the
chances of war, caused me some anxiety. It is well over,
and I congratulate you upon this success, which will lead to
the pacification of the Dayaks and the improved security of
Sarawak. You have the warm thanks of your Rajah and
uncle, who only regrets he has no other reward to bestow
but his praise of your ability, zeal, and prudence. You
deserve honour and wealth as the meed due to your merit,"
so wrote the Rajah to the Tuan Muda on receipt of the
news.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Serikei and Nyalong Dayaks had received due
punishment at the hands of the Tuan Muda, and peace now
reigned along the coast and in the interior. The Kayans
alone remained to be humbled, and the remaining actual
murderers of Steele and Fox, Sakalai, Sawing, and Talip,
whom they were harbouring, to be punished.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the beginning of February, 1862, after a month's
detention in Kuching suffering from jungle fever, the Tuan
Muda left for England. After an arduous journey to the
head-waters of the Batang Lupar and overland to the
Katibas, by which river and the Rejang he returned, his
health had broken down, and it became necessary for him
to return to Europe to recruit. He had now been in
Sarawak for nearly ten years, for the greater part of the
time at Sekrang, and had been engaged in many very trying
expeditions.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>I left Sekrang and Saribas in perfect confidence in Mr. Watson's
ability to manage affairs during my absence, and felt sure the natives
would support him to the uttermost. For a few days previously I
had conferred with all the Dayak chiefs, and begged them to desist
from head-hunting and prevent their people running loose as in
former times. They spoke well, and assured me of their staunch
support.</p>

<p class='c000'>Amongst the many who had collected to bid him farewell
was the octogenarian Sherip Mular, the intrepid enemy
of former days, but who had long since become a peaceful
member of society, and a friend of the Tuan Muda.</p>

As we have already
noticed,
the action of
the <em>Nemesis</em>
with a fleet
of Balanini
pirates off
Bruni in
May, 1847, following
on the destruction
by Admiral
Cochrane of the pirate strongholds
in North Borneo, for
some years effectually checked
the marauding expeditions of
the pirates down the north-west coast of
Borneo. This lesson was shortly afterwards
followed up by the destruction of the Balanini
strongholds by the Spanish, who a few years later destroyed
Tianggi, or Sug, the principal town in Sulu. The Dutch
had also been active. The pirates were crippled and
scattered, and a period of immunity from their depredations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>followed these vigorous measures. But the efforts of the
three powers mainly concerned in the suppression of piracy
subsequently relaxed, and the pirates, who had gradually
established themselves in other places on the coast of Borneo
and in neighbouring islands,
gained courage by
the absence of patrolling
cruisers, and again burst
forth.</p>

<div  class='figleft id014'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>SULU KRIS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The year 1858 was
marked by a great revival of
Lanun and Balagnini piracy.
Among others, a Spanish
vessel was taken in the Sulu
seas by Panglima Taupan of
Tawi-Tawi: a young girl,
the daughter of a Spanish
merchant, was the only one
on board not massacred.
Taupan took her for a wife;
and, as I wrote at the time,—"Alas
for the chivalry of the British Navy! Sir ——,
who was present when this
information was given, said
it was a Spanish affair, not
ours." Another fruit of the
Commission—officers dared
not act.<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c011'><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>No more terrible fate
can be conceived than that
to which this poor girl,
who had witnessed the
murder of her father, was dragged, but had a British man-of-war
been present it is doubtful whether her Commander would
have interfered, unless he were prepared to sacrifice duty to
compassion. For, after the notorious Commission, the Admiralty
had issued stringent commands that unless a vessel should
have, within view, attacked some <em>British</em> vessel or subject,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>or that there was proof that she had done so, she was not
to be molested. It was a revival of the former order of
1844, which, though it contained the same strict limit,
allowed some latitude to a Commander.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah was rightly of opinion that</p>

<p class='c013'>These orders are a direct violation of our treaties with Holland
and with Bruni.<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c011'><sup>[270]</sup></a> Such a course of action with pirates has never
been pursued before by any civilised nation, and is manifestly
calculated to destroy our commerce, wherever it may be practically
acted upon. Let either the Lanun or Chinese pirates know that we
shall not molest them unless they commit depredations on the
English flag, and they would sweep away a million of commerce
on these seas, which was bound to English markets in native
bottoms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the inhabitants and commerce of neighbouring
countries continued to suffer, up to 1861 the pirates gave
Sarawak a wide berth. Then they began to appear on the
coast again, but the little Sarawak gunboats were on the
alert. The principal object of the pirates was not to fight,
but to obtain plunder and captives, and they afforded the
gunboats only a few long shots. Still they managed to
capture a few people, including some natives of Madras,
British subjects. But in 1862 they were out in increased
numbers.</p>

<p class='c000'>In that year Captain Brooke, the Rajah Muda, met with a
great loss, his second wife died at Kuching, after having given
birth to her first child.<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c011'><sup>[271]</sup></a> This occurred on May 6, and after
a few days it was thought by his friends that he might find
some mental relief in change of scene and active work.
Accordingly he was persuaded to undertake a voyage to
Bintulu, and Bishop McDougall volunteered to accompany
him so as to cheer and support him. Mr. Helms, agent of
the Borneo Company, joined the party and was dropped at
Muka. On the second day after the arrival of Mr. Helms,
and when the Rajah Muda had left in the <em>Rainbow</em>, a piratical
fleet of Lanuns, consisting of six large and many small vessels,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>appeared off the mouth of the Muka river and blockaded the
place. For a couple of days they remained there, making
excursions on land, and capturing thirty-two persons. Mr.
Helms despatched a party of natives in a fast boat that
succeeded in eluding the pirates, though they narrowly
escaped capture, to make known the state of affairs to the
Rajah Muda, and they found him still at Bintulu.</p>

<p class='c000'>On May 25, the little screw-steamer <em>Rainbow</em>, carrying
two 9-pounder guns, steamed out of Bintulu, and at once
engaged a detachment of three Lanun prahus, one of which
was sunk, and another captured; the third was engaged by
the <em>Jolly Bachelor</em> and driven on the rocks off Kedurong point,
and her crew taking refuge ashore were hunted down and
killed by the Bintulu people. Learning from the captives
the direction taken by the remainder of the fleet, the Rajah
Muda stood out to sea in search of them.</p>

<p class='c013'>After an hour or so, wrote the Bishop, the look-out at the
mast-head reported three vessels in sight, right ahead. At this
time it was quite calm, and when we came near enough to see them
from the deck, we saw them sweep up to the central vessel and lay
themselves side by side, with their bows at us, as if they meant to
engage us in that position. However, as we went on towards them
the sea-breeze sprang up, so they changed their tactics, and opened
out in line with their broadsides towards us to rake us as we came
up. Our plan was, as before, to shake them first and run them down
in detail. Brooke did not give the order to fire until we came within
250 yards of them, and they opened their lelahs (brass swivel-guns)
upon us some time before we commenced firing. They fired briskly
and did not attempt to get away, even when we got all our guns to
bear upon them; but as we steamed round to get our stem fairly at
the sternmost vessel, they seemed to think we were retreating, and
pelted us with shot more sharply than ever, directing their chief
attention to us on the poop, where we had one man killed and two
severely wounded in no time, and we should have suffered more
if the temporary bulwark of planks, etc., had not stopped their balls.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the first prahu was run down, I had to go below to attend
to our own wounded as they came in, but I plainly felt the concussion
as we went into the others. One of the vessels was cut
right in two; the steamer went straight on without backing, and
she sank the other, one half on each side of us. She was the
largest, and had a valuable cargo, and much gold and bags of Dutch
rupees. The pirates fought to the last, and then would not surrender,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>but jumped into the sea with their arms; and the poor captives,
who were all made fast below as we came up to engage them, were
doubtless glad when our stem opened the sides of their ships and
thus let them out of their prison. Few, comparatively, were drowned,
being mostly all good swimmers. All those who were not lashed to
the vessels or killed by the Illanuns escaped. Our decks were soon
covered with those we picked up, men of every race and nation in
the Archipelago,<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c011'><sup>[272]</sup></a> who had been captured by the pirates in their
cruise. One poor Chinese came swimming alongside, waving his
tail over his head, and the other captives held up the cords round
their necks to show they were slaves, lest they should be mistaken
for Illanuns and shot or left to their fate. We soon picked up the
poor fellows, and the Chinaman came under my hands, being shot
through the arm. Many of the pirates we took were badly wounded,
some mortally, the greater part were killed or disabled by our fire
before we closed.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is a marvel how these poor creatures live at all under the
terrible tortures and ill-treatment they endure, sometimes for months,
before they reach their destination and settle down as slaves to the
worst of masters—very demons, not men. The captives state that
when the pirates take a vessel, they kill every one who makes any
resistance, plunder and sink their boats or ships, and when those
they spare are first taken on board their own prahus, they put a
rattan, or black rope-halter, round their necks, beat them with a
flat piece of bamboo on the elbows and knees and the muscles of
the arms and legs, so that they cannot use them to swim or run
away. After a while, when sufficiently tamed, they are put to the
sweeps and made to row in gangs, with one of their fellow-captives
as a mandore or foreman over them, who is furnished with a rattan
to keep them at their work; and if he does not do this effectually,
he is "krissed" and thrown overboard, and another man put in his
place. If any of the rowers jump overboard, the pirates have a
supply of three-pronged and barbed spears, with long bamboo
handles, ready to throw at them. When hit by one of these they
can neither swim nor run, and are easily recaptured. They are
made to row in relays night and day, and to keep them awake they
put cayenne pepper in their eyes or cut them with their knives and
put pepper in their wounds.</p>

<p class='c013'>We found, on reckoning up, that we had picked up 165
people, and that 150 to 200 men had got to land from the vessels
we sank near the shore. In every pirate vessel there were forty or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>or fifty Illanuns, fighting men, all well armed, each having a
rifle or musket besides his native weapons, and from 60 to 70
captives, many of whom were killed by the pirates when they
found themselves beaten; among them two women. Seven of the
women and four of the children were our own Muka people<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c011'><sup>[273]</sup></a> and it
was indeed most touching to witness the joy and gratitude of them
and their relations when we returned them to their friends. Of the
Illanuns we captured 32, ten of them boys. Some have died
since of their wounds, the remainder are in irons in the fort
here. The boys have been given out by Brooke for five years to
respectable people to train and bring up. Very few of the pirates
live to tell the tale; some captives assured us in the boat they were
in there were only two out of the forty fighting-men who had not
been killed or wounded by our fire, when we gave them the stem
and cut them down.</p>

<p class='c013'>Under the present system at Labuan, and the difficulties thrown
in the way of our men-of-war against attacking these wretches when
they are known to be in the neighbourhood, England with all her
power and philanthropy is doing absolutely nothing towards putting
an end to this abominable and most extensive system of rapine,
murder, and slavery. It is impossible to estimate the destruction
and the havoc, the murder and the amount of slave-dealing carried
on by these wretches in their yearly cruises. The prahus we met
were but one of the many squadrons that leave Sulu every year.
Seven months had these wretches been devastating the villages on the
coast, capturing slaves, taking and sinking trading vessels. Their
course was along the coasts of Celebes, down the Macassar Straits to
Madura and then along the Northern coast of Java, and the South
of Borneo, up the Caramata passage to Borneo, to go home by
Sarawak and Labuan. The other five pirate vessels parted
company from them to go over to Balliton<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c011'><sup>[274]</sup></a> and Banca Straits, and
doubtless they too will carry their depredations right up into the
Straits of Singapore and pick up English subjects and injure
English trade, as those we met have done. But apart from all
our local feelings, and danger from these people, it makes an
Englishman out here ashamed to feel that his own dear country,
which we would fain regard as the liberator of the slave and the
avenger of the wronged, is in truth doing nothing against the system,
fraught with incalculable misery to so large a section of the human
race. For it must be remembered that the slavery these people
suffer is far more crushing to them than the African who is taken
as a savage to serve civilised and at least, nominally, Christian
masters; but these are generally well-to-do men of civilised nations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>who are made the slaves of utter fiends, who work and torture
them to death one year, only to replace them by fresh victims
whom they capture the next. It is indeed <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vae victis</span></i> with them, and
I think it is the duty of every Christian man and every Christian
nation to do all that can be done to rid the earth of such horrible
and dangerous monsters, and to punish the Sultan of Sulu and all
who abet and aid them. The Dutch and Spaniards are always
doing something, but not enough, and during the last four or five
years, these pirate fleets have been gradually getting more and
more numerous and daring on these coasts, and now it is for
England to rouse herself and complete the work of putting them
down. Labuan is near their haunts and it might be done from thence.
A few thousands spent out here yearly for the purpose would,
I believe in my heart, soon effect more real and lasting good than
the millions which are being spent on the coast of Africa. All
honour is due to Sir James Brooke and his nephew, the Rajah
Muda, and the other officers of the Sarawak government, who in
spite of misrepresentation and factious opposition, through evil
report and good report, have persevered for years in constant,
steady, and systematic efforts to put down piracy on this coast
and chastise these villainous marauders whenever they come into
Sarawak waters. If the English government will now act with and
assist us, we shall soon clear the Sarawak and Labuan waters of
these pests. Assisted by the knowledge and experience of our
natives, the work would be done surely and effectually; but single-handed
the Sarawak government notwithstanding all it has done,
cannot carry it out. We want means; if England or Englishmen
will give us that, we shall gladly do the work, and feel that we are
delivering our fellow-men, and doing our duty to God, who has
commanded us to free the captive and deliver the oppressed.
While at the same time we shall be averting a danger which is
ever threatening us at our own doors, and has so long crippled the
energies and resources of this country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The original fleet of Lanuns had consisted of eleven
prahus, but off the western coast of Borneo five had parted
company and stayed behind to cruise around Banka and
Belitong. Shortly afterwards one of her Majesty's ships
fell in with three of them and attempted to take them, but
the pirates managed to effect their escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>On board the little steamer were at the time eight
Europeans, the stalwart Pangiran Matusin, a fighting
haji, and fifteen natives. But though the pirates were far
more numerous, and were all well armed, yet the steamer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>had the preponderating advantage of her screw, enabling her
to ram each native vessel, cut her in half and send her to
the bottom, so that there could not be doubt for a moment
what would be the outcome of such a conflict.</p>

<p class='c000'>The results of the fight were these:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The prisoners, with the exception of the lads, were all
executed. The lads were put to work on the gunboats,
and became excellent and trustworthy sailors—one, who
was the son of a Lanun of rank, subsequently commanded
the present Rajah's former yacht the <em>Aline</em>. Some of the
captives were Dutch subjects, and some were British subjects
from Singapore. In the captured pirate prahu there were
found five Dutch and one Spanish ensign.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sailing along past the delta of the Rejang, when off the
pretty little village of Palo, which was hidden from their
view, the pirates had observed a long canoe laden with nipah
palm leaves, with a man in the stern and a woman in the
bows, paddling for dear life to escape. A light canoe
manned by half-a-dozen men was at once despatched in
chase, and quickly overhauled the poor couple, the man
crying out that he surrendered, and the woman screaming
with fear. It was a pretty example of the biter bit—a
neatly contrived trap. Gliding alongside to secure their
apparently helpless captives, without troubling to exchange
paddles for weapons, to their amazement the pirates saw an
upheaval of the leaves and several armed men spring up,
together with the steersman and the disguised man in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>bows. This startling development took the pirates so completely
by surprise that they were all speared before they
could seize their weapons. The Melanaus then quickly disappeared
up a creek. Their leader was the late Atoh, a
young man then, who afterwards became the Government
chief of Palo. He is perhaps better known to the present
generation as Haji Abdul Rahman.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following translation of a paper written by a Nakoda
Amzah, one of the rescued captives, and found amongst his
papers after his death, gives a good account of the voyage
of this fleet, and of its destruction. He was a Kampar
(Sumatra) Malay, who lived in Sarawak since his rescue.
He, his grandson, and another Malay were killed in the
Rejang in 1880 by a head-hunting party of Dayaks. He
was noted for his courage. He had been twice before
captured by pirates. In this translation the word "pirate"
is substituted for Bajau, Lanun, and Balanini, which the
writer uses indiscriminately, and no doubt the crews of the
piratical prahus were an admixture of these tribes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thursday, the 17th day of the month Sawal in the year of the
Hejira 1278 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1862). On this day Nakoda Amzah who was
on a voyage to Samarang, with a crew of twelve men, was attacked
off the mouth of the Jali by piratical prahus. These must have
been eleven in all; they afterwards separated, six going along the
coast of Borneo, and five coasting to Bangka. The attack was
sudden, and they did their best to beat the pirates off, but after
having fought them for about an hour, three of Nakoda Amzah's
men were killed, and he himself was wounded in the head by a
bullet. They then surrendered and were captured by the pirates;
their own prahu was destroyed, and they were transferred to the
pirates' prahus. The pirates then sailed to Pulo Kelam, where
they hauled their prahus up a creek out of sight, there being a
Dutch war vessel out of Benjarmasin on the look out for piratical
prahus. This vessel steamed round the island without detecting
them. They stayed here three days, and on the fourth launched
their prahus and sailed northwards. The next day they again
saw the steamer to the westward, so bore down to the island of
Jempodi, where they stayed in hiding for six days. Sailing on,
between Pakar and Kaiong the pirates captured a sampan with
five men, and they also captured a woman. In two days more
they reached the mouth of Katapang, and Kandang Krabu, where
they made an unsuccessful raid; but they captured two men who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>were out fishing. Two days afterwards they arrived at and
attacked Pulo Kumbang, but the people were away inland, so no
captures were effected. The next day they made a descent on
Sati point, and captured three Chinese and three Malays. They
sailed on for two days more, and then tried at Mas Tiga, but did
not succeed in capturing any one. Two days afterwards they fell in
with a Dutch Government coastguard, commanded by one Rasip.
They engaged the coastguard, but owing to a strong westerly wind
were forced to leave her. After four days, between Karamata and
Pulo Datu, they fell in with a Sambas prahu belonging to Haji
Bakir, she proved to be from Belitong, loaded with dry fish, sago,
etc. The pirates captured her and her crew of five men. The
whole of the next day they were chased by a war steamer, but they
escaped by keeping in shoal water, and by night falling. Five days
afterwards, off Cape Baiong, they fell in with Nakoda Daud's prahu
from Sambas, but did not molest her. Three days later they had
passed Cape Datu, and brought up for two days in Serabang bay
and read the Ruah Selamat.<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c011'><sup>[275]</sup></a> A three days' sail brought them to
Cape Sirik, just before reaching which they fell in with two prahus
which they attacked but were beaten off; they also chased a small
boat but that escaped inshore. The next night at Bruit they killed
two Melanaus, and captured two men and two women. Two nights
after, off the mouth of Oya, they captured four Melanau women and
two men. At Muka, which they reached next day, they captured
four Chinese and two Melanaus, and the next night they brought
up off Bintulu.<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c011'><sup>[276]</sup></a> The following day was a fatal day for the pirates,
for in the morning a steamer (the <em>Rainbow</em>) came out of Bintulu
accompanied by a pinnace (the <em>Jolly Bachelor</em>). There was a
pirate prahu lying close in shore and upon her the steamer
immediately fired; twice the steamer fired and then the prahu's
crew ran her into shoal water, she was followed and attacked by the
pinnace, and her crew then escaped ashore, but were all killed by
men from Bintulu and Miri. The steamer then attacked another
prahu—and after firing into her twice rammed and sank her. Her
crew were all drowned, killed, or captured, and the captives, about
twenty in number, escaped on board the steamer. A similar fate
overtook a third prahu, all her crew perishing, and her captives,
about twenty-five in number, were rescued by the steamer. The
steamer then gave chase to the three prahus in the offing and
overtook them. These three prahus were lashed together, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>separated after being fired into. A short engagement ensued,
which resulted in all three of the prahus being sunk, and their
crews being killed or captured. Twenty-one captives were rescued
from their prahus. And thus were the pirates destroyed off Bintulu
by the Rajah of Sarawak's steamer the <em>Rainbow</em>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Moreover it is estimated that the pirates lost forty men killed,
and the steamer lost but one man killed and one wounded. And
thus Nakoda Amzah and three of his men were rescued, and
reached Kuching in safety. The remaining six were taken away in
the other five prahus that sailed to Belitong and Bangka, and were
probably taken by their captors to Sulu during the month of Haji.</p>

<p class='c013'>Written in Kuching on Friday the 6th day of Dulkaidah, 1278
of the Hejira (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1862).</p>

<p class='c000'>This was a lesson the pirates never forgot. From
one of their prahus nineteen men escaped in a fast boat
to carry the tale back with them, soon to spread to all
the pirate haunts. Only once since, some seven years
later, did the pirates venture down to the Sarawak coast,
and then in no great force. They were attacked in
Kedurong bay, and slain to a man by the Bintulu people
led by their own chiefs. No more pirates were seen on the
Sarawak coast afterwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next year a squadron of steamers was sent from
China to attack and root out all these pirates; but they
came for no end except to sport their bunting, for nothing
was effected. They could have had no intelligence officer
with them with a knowledge of the positions of the piratical
strongholds, and acquainted with the languages, habits, and
appearance of the inhabitants of the northern coast of
Borneo and the Sulu archipelago.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the pirates never troubled Sarawak again,
they continued their operations in other parts for many
years afterwards. As late as 1872, Dutch squadrons had
to be sent out against them along the east coast of Borneo.
And in 1874 piracy was so rife in the Sulu seas, and the
Spanish gunboats so unable to suppress it, that the
Governor-General of the Philippines issued an edict dooming
the "Moorish marine" to destruction. The Spanish
cruisers were to destroy <em>all</em> prahus proceeding from the
Sulu islands or Tawi Tawi. Their crews were to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>conveyed to Manila to labour on public works, and those
found armed were to be punished by the Military Courts.
It was hoped that these untameable and seafaring races
would be thus compelled to live by agricultural pursuits
alone. This merciless condemnation of peaceable traders
and voyagers as well as the evil-doers naturally led to gross
injustice, and to intense hatred of the Spaniards. Even
those not bearing arms, engaged in peaceful pursuits, if
apprehended, were doomed to compulsory labour; whereas
those found armed, met with short shrift—and all were
compelled to be armed for their own protection.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1879, the pirates of Tungku, a place near Sandakan,
the last stronghold of the Balanini and Lanun pirates in
northern Borneo, made several excursions along the coast
capturing as many as 200 people. Then the place was
destroyed by H.M.S. <em>Kestrel</em>. (It had been attacked before
by the <em>Cleopatra</em> in 1851.) Shortly afterwards the British
North Borneo Company established their government in
North Borneo, and piracy virtually ceased along the coasts
of Borneo.</p>

<p>KAYAN MORTUARY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Early in 1863, the Rajah
was again obliged to
leave for Sarawak, owing
to certain complications
having arisen, due to the
acts of his nephew,
the Rajah Muda.</p>

<p class='c000'>Into this matter
it is not our intention
to enter at length. It has
already been dealt with fully in both
Miss Jacob's and Sir Spencer St.
John's biographies of the Rajah, and
it is sufficient to say here that it was
mainly the result of an inexplicable
misconception of the policy being
pursued by the Rajah in England.</p>

<p class='c000'>The formal recognition of Sarawak was the sole
proposal before the British Government. It is true the
Rajah trusted that having once gained this England would
not leave Sarawak to her fate in the event of the failure of
his Government; but he wrote: "On every account of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>feeling of pride, of attachment to the people, I desire the
Government to be continued." The negotiations had not
extended to any overtures for a transfer, or proposals of
protection. Recognition at this time was all important,
not only to give a status to the Government, and confidence
to the people, but to encourage the introduction of capital,
without which the country could not advance.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was against the mistaken idea of a transfer of the
country to England that the Rajah Muda protested. Yet
a short time before he himself had suggested such a transfer
to Belgium, and, a few years previously that the country
should be sold either to England or to the Borneo
Company.</p>

<p class='c000'>We may mention here that the negotiations with
Belgium had fallen through the previous year. The reason
is not difficult to discover, for the Rajah wrote: "I wrote
to you about the Duke of Brabant and my talk with him.
His views must change greatly before I entrust our people
to his guardianship."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Premier, Lord Palmerston, and the Secretary for
Foreign Affairs, Lord John Russell, with other influential
members of both Houses, were now very favourably
inclined towards the Rajah and Sarawak. Lord John
Russell had pledged himself to lay the statement of facts
as prepared by the Rajah before the Law Officers of the
crown for their opinion, and should it be favourable to
bring the question of recognition of Sarawak before the
Cabinet.<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c011'><sup>[277]</sup></a> The Law Officers were called upon to decide
whether Sarawak was independent of or feudatory to Bruni.
The decision was favourable, for Lord John Russell
subsequently wrote to the Rajah: "If your authority is
undisputed, he (Lord Russell) is now ready at once to
propose to the Cabinet the recognition of Sarawak as an
independent State under your rule and Government."</p>

<p class='c000'>Before his return to England the Rajah heard that
recognition had been granted, though he was not officially
notified of the fact until his arrival there. It was full and
complete; and a Consul was appointed to Sarawak for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>whom an <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">exequatur</span></i> was asked of the Rajah.<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c011'><sup>[278]</sup></a> The Rajah's
forethought, which we have already recorded, that "time
brings changes, and may work on the British Government"
was thus fully justified. The Duke of Newcastle, Lords
Palmerston and John Russell, Sir G. Grey, the Honble.
Sidney Herbert, and Mr. Gladstone had been members of
the Cabinet that issued the Commission, as they were now
members of the Cabinet that granted the long refused
recognition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tuan Muda had accompanied the Rajah from
England. He had assumed the surname of Brooke by the
desire of his uncle, and this had been decided upon before
the defection of his brother had been known. The Rajah
desired it because it was the name of the ruling family, and
it would remove confusion and ambiguity, and place his
nephew in a clearer position before the world. The Tuan
Muda refused to take the title of Rajah Muda, or to be
formally recognised as his uncle's heir, trusting that his
brother might pave the way to reconciliation and to his
reinstatement.<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c011'><sup>[279]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst the Rajah remained at Kuching to restore order,
and to introduce proper systems into the various departments,
the Tuan Muda returned to Sekrang, where he was
received with many demonstrations of good feeling. The
population turned out and towed and escorted his pinnace
up the river, and salutes were fired wherever he passed. But
they were not more glad to welcome him, than he was to
see them. He then visited all the out-stations as far as
Bintulu. Muka he found prosperous, and the people happy.
He then returned to Sekrang to prepare for the expedition
against the Kayans.</p>

<p class='c000'>This powerful tribe has already been spoken of as living
far inland on the head-waters of the Rejang. They were a
continual trouble to the Dayaks who lived on that same
river, but lower down, raiding their country, taking heads,
and making captives, whom they tortured to death. Their
country was not easily accessible, on account of the rapids
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>in the river. The first rapids on the Rejang are about 170
miles from the mouth; these passed, the river is navigable
for sixty miles, then ensue further rapids for about five miles,
and then again it is navigable for fifty more. The upper
rapids, called those of Makun, are the most serious and
difficult to overcome, so serious, indeed, that the Kayans did
not suppose it possible that an enemy could ascend above them.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it was necessary to chastise and bring these troublesome
neighbours into subjection. Before the Tuan Muda
had left for England an ultimatum had been sent to Akam
Nipa to deliver up the murderers of Steele and Fox. They
had been committing great depredations on the lower
Rejang, and Mr. Cruickshank, the Resident there, had
appealed to the Government at Kuching to bridle them.
Not only were the murderers of Messrs. Steele and Fox
with them, but, as we have previously mentioned, they
had lately descended and made a treacherous attack on
the Katibas Dayaks, who had stood true to the Sarawak
Government. Professing friendship, they had seized an
occasion when most of the men of Katibas were absent,
and had killed seventeen of the men who had remained at
their homes, and a hundred women and children. Their
captives they tortured in the most horrible manner, hacking
them with knives and gouging out their eyes before putting
them to death. And not only were the men thus treated,
but also most of the women. They burnt fourteen long
houses, or villages, and decamped.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they had engaged a man named Paring to lure
some of the Dayaks into an ambush. Paring, a Kayan, had
married a Dayak wife, and when he came to Katibas to
visit his wife's relations he persuaded eighteen men to
accompany him into the Kayan country to propose terms of
peace, and when they demurred he made himself responsible
for the safety of the whole party. Having thus overcome
their fears he led them to a place where the Kayans, under
their chief Oyong Hang,<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c011'><sup>[280]</sup></a> were lurking in waiting for them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>Eleven were at once bound hand and foot, but seven
managed to escape into the jungle, and after several days
returned in a famished condition to Katibas. The eleven
were conveyed up the river, and on their way were carried
into every Kayan house to be tortured by the women. On
arriving at Oyong Hang's abode, one of them named Boyong
was singled out to be sacrificed
so as to attend in the
abode of spirits the soul of
Oyong Hang's son, who had
lately died. He was to be
buried alive under a huge
wooden pillar, the mausoleum
of Oyong Hang's son, early
on the following morning.
However, during the night,
Boyong and another effected
their escape, ran into the
jungle, and found their way
to the foot of the first rapids
after twenty days' wandering.
They were then in such an
exhausted condition that
they found it impossible to
proceed further on foot, accordingly
they lashed themselves
by rattans to a log
in the river, drifted down
stream, and were eventually
picked up and rescued.
All the remaining men were strangled by the Kayans. The
scoundrel Paring, not thinking that his villainy had been
disclosed, had the audacity to go among the Dayaks again,
when he was seized and brought to Kanowit, where he was
sentenced to death. But when in confinement, awaiting the
approval of the sentence from Kuching, he effected his
escape. The alarm was, however, at once given, and he
was pursued into the jungle by the Dayaks and killed.</p>

<p>OLD PUNAN MORTUARY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In an expedition such as was contemplated, the Rajah
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>or his deputy was obliged to obtain the voluntary assistance
of his subjects. He had no paid army, he did not even
provision the host for the expedition.</p>

<p class='c000'>On this occasion the Tuan Muda consulted some of the
chiefs at Sekrang as to the feasibility of attacking the Kayans.
The Dayaks were never unwilling to join in such an excursion,
though the only inducement that could be held out was loot,
and relief from further annoyance. But it was laid down by
the Government that no woman or child was to be molested.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the chiefs thought that the proposed attack might be
made, arrangements were pressed forward, and on May 19,
1863, at sunset, two guns were fired as a preparatory signal
for the start from Sekrang, and the Tuan Muda led the
party that was to proceed thence down the Batang Lupar
and coast to the mouth of the Rejang, picking up on the
way contingents of volunteers. Mr. Watson was at Kabong
(Kalaka) at the head of a detachment, and Mr. Stuart Johnson
was waiting at Kanowit, along with Sergeant Lees in charge
of guns, muskets, and ammunition.</p>

<p class='c000'>At mid-day on the 20th, the expedition started from
Sekrang, "My crew were mostly old followers and servants
who had been with me for years. Our boat was in perfect
order, well painted and decorated with flags; for nothing
tells so much as pride instilled and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i> encouraged
in the minds of the people."<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c011'><sup>[281]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On the 21st, Lingga was reached and Banting visited.
The natives there, the Banting or Balau Dayaks, were not
eager to join the expedition as they were behindhand in
their farming operations; however, after some hesitation and
delay, they followed. On the 23rd, Kabong was attained,
the town at the mouth of the Kalaka river. Here were
Malays, useful fighting men, but for all that they showed
reluctance to unite in the expedition. This is easily
explicable, as they were apprehensive of attacking tribes at
such a distance, and whom they had been bred up to fear
as the most powerful in Borneo. And the Malays, unlike
the Sea-Dayaks, though braver, do not love fighting for the
sake of fighting. They shirked, but they went.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>On the 24th, at starting the contingent consisted of sixty
boats, with an average of forty men in each, and pushed up
the mouth of the Rejang to Serikei, and Mr. Watson had
gone on with forty boats from Saribas. On the following
day Sibu was reached, where lived the Banyoks. Tani had
been their chief, the conspirator who had been sentenced to
death by the Tuan Muda, as mentioned in a previous chapter.
But now Tani's son, Buju,<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c011'><sup>[282]</sup></a> at the head of his fighting men,
readily joined forces to those of the Tuan Muda. On
the 29th at 2 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> by hard paddling, Kanowit was reached.
"At daylight our force had congregated about the village
and on each bank of the river, which was so broad that
thousands of boats would not have made much show. After
having coffee, I commenced work with Sergeant Lees in
examining all the stores, arms, and ammunition. The heavy
guns and shot had been already despatched by the Kanowit
and Katibas boats, which were now two days' start ahead
of us. I had arranged that the foot of the first rapids
should be our rendezvous, and the enemy were reported
to be six days distant above this point. It took the greater
part of the day distributing arms, ammunition, and sundry
other things to be carried by the force. Our Europeans of
the party were Messrs. Watson, Cruickshank, my younger
brother, Sergeant Lees, and Lucas (the Captain) of the <em>Venus</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>26th.</em>—The principal natives persuaded me to remain
over to-day or I would have pushed on to lose no time in
this fine weather. They require time to settle many little
matters with which they are particular. Some made their
wills, others sent letters to their nearest relatives, acquainting
them with their last wishes, and all our boats needed much
preparation. The one prepared for me, into which I had
to shift all my things, was sixty-six feet long, shaped like a
coffin and totally devoid of elegance and beauty. She
consisted of a single tree hollowed out and round at the
bottom, but raised a little at her extremities. When the
hollowing out is done, a bow and a stern-piece are fastened
with rattans; they have not a nail in them; two light
planks are also tied on top and then they are complete.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Some have much speed, and are capable of carrying from
forty to seventy men with a month's provision on board.
They are adapted for passing the rapids, are buoyant in the
falls, and the crews are able to use a long sweeping stroke
with the paddles, such as could not be managed in shorter
boats.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>29th.</em>—As the fort clock struck eight, a gun was fired as
a signal for starting, and about eighty boats left together;
others had been going on during the night, and many were
still behind. The current ran strong against us, and we
were forced to hug the bank.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The banks above Kanowit are steep, and Kanowit
itself may be said to be the first pretty spot in the Rejang
river, but above it is much variety of scenery—windings of the
river, hills and hillocks of every shape."</p>

<p class='c000'>As they ascended, ruined habitations and deserted
paddy-fields were passed, that had been ravaged by the
Kayans; to put a term to their violence a fort had been
erected at Ngmah, between Katibas and Kanowit. This
was now dismantled by the Tuan Muda on his way up, and
he took the men and guns along with him. Above the
junction of the Katibas with the Rejang for over a hundred
miles the country was uninhabited.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 31st, the Baleh river, the left hand branch of the
Rejang, was passed. Here the character of the scenery
changes, the sides become craggy, and the river rolls over
masses of rock, and through veritable gorges, with a swift
current.</p>

<p class='c000'>On June the 1st, the foot of the first rapid was reached,
where the rendezvous had been appointed. Here all those
who had gone on before were assembled in thousands.
"Groups of Dayaks in all directions—some lounging on
rocks, or on the patches of white sand in the bight,
others mending their boats which they had hauled up in the
most favourable places. Many were squatting round fires
and cooking. Bright colours of clothes, flags, and painted
boats were interspersed among them."</p>

<p class='c000'>A council was held that same afternoon, and further
proceedings were discussed. A hundred chiefs were present,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>and the Tuan Muda spoke, arranging the order of the bala,
and insisting that the lives of women and children must be
spared, and that the chiefs should be held responsible for
the conduct of their followers. He was followed by Balang,
"an ugly little broad man, with the jowl of a hog," the
chief of Katibas, whose house had been burnt by the Kayans,
all his property carried off, and many of his relatives and
people killed. "I have no wish to return," said he, "if
this expedition is unsuccessful. They may cook my head if
I can't cook theirs."<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c011'><sup>[283]</sup></a> The force then consisted of 300
boats carrying 12,000 men.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the following day the ascent of the Pelagus rapids
was begun. The boats were forced up by the men with
poles in their hands, and were aided by others on the banks
hauling with ropes; whilst others again, where the water
was shallow, were immersed in it pulling and shoving.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Men seemed like ducks in the water. Swimmers and
divers all had their duties, and the amount of exertion of
this kind which the natives will undergo is simply wonderful.
They keep it up hour after hour in the coldest mountain
stream, jumping on to and over places where an Englishman
could not gain a foothold, as the rocks are slippery as
glass, and many of the ridges are not over three inches wide,
making one giddy to look at them."</p>

<p class='c000'>After a while the first portion of the rapids was safely
surmounted, and a basin of calmly flowing water was reached.
But this was not far, it afforded a breathing space before the
next difficult point was reached, a perpendicular fall of ten
feet. Here was a portage; provisions, arms, and ammunition
had to be carried by land, and the boats hauled over sixty
feet of a steep rocky incline, covered with water when the
river was full, but now left dry. In the process, however, a
good many of the boats went to pieces, and the crews had
to be partitioned among the others.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was followed by another fall, that had to be surmounted
in the same way. "This last was a terrible job,
and at every foot gained, I thought my coffin would have
gone in two, as she creaked piteously. But at last we gained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>the summit of the first rapids. Here we stopped, as the crews
required rest, and the sun was piercingly hot." The whole
length of this first rapid is four miles, and the breadth of
the river six hundred yards. Not one third of the force had
as yet surmounted it, and some were discouraged and made
no attempt to do so.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Next day, the 3rd, the Tuan Muda's thirty-fourth birthday,
the coffin was advancing up stream where the river
was broken up by islets and running between them, like a
mill race, followed by the boat containing Mr. Cruickshank
and Mr. Stuart Johnson, when, in punting, it was driven
against a submerged rock and at once began to fill. Seizing
his gold watch and chain, the Tuan Muda sprang into the
water and swam to the boat that followed and was taken in;
but provisions, the Tuan Muda's sword, spyglass, rugs, etc.,
all new from England, were irretrievably lost, and the whole
crew were boatless; for the coffin was whirled down the
stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>4th.</em>—We advanced again as usual, and after about an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>hour's hard pulling and many ropes, the stream became
smooth and deep, and no more rocks were in sight. The
reaches were long and straight, with a steady current of
two and a half knots. The land was level without being
swampy, and the soil appeared to be a rich yellow loam.
What land for agriculture! and it extends for miles."</p>

<p class='c000'>They were now on the fringe of the Kayan country, and
they came on the remains of the house of the chief Akam
Nipa, which he had deserted. The enemy had retired before
the advancing force, and not one had as yet shown himself;
though a small party, consisting of seven men, that had gone
into the jungle hunting, three days before, thinking that
the Kayans had all retreated, had incautiously lain down
to sleep, when they were captured, tortured slowly to death
on the spot, and then decapitated.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 6th, the Tekok rapids were encountered, and
another abandoned Kayan village passed. The hills now
began to show, and the river to flow over rocks and between
bluffs. Had this spot been held by the enemy, it would
have been most difficult to pass, but they had considered it
best to retreat.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 7th, the abandoned village of the Sekapans<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c011'><sup>[284]</sup></a> was
reached and committed to the flames. There, farming
grounds with the jungle freshly cut were found on both
sides of the river. The scenery was very beautiful, but there
was very little cultivation. The bays are sometimes five
hundred yards in width, giving the appearance of a landlocked
lake rather than a running river. The height of the
hills varies under a thousand feet. Many fruit trees were on
the bank.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We were pulling with all our sinews, having continued
it since morning, when at 3 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> we descried a sampan
manned by a crew dressed in various colours, steering for us.
They brought news of the enemy being fortified in a house<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c011'><sup>[285]</sup></a>
round the next point, and on the leading boats approaching
they were fired into, and some were killed and others
wounded. The enemy's house was already surrounded, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>said, but every time our fellows advanced some were shot
down.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Our crew pulled on, and on rounding the point, the
stockaded dwelling of the enemy hove in sight, situated on
a low spit. We steered across, out of the enemy's range
into the bay, where all the boats of the advance party had
collected."</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing could be effected till more of the force had
come up, and till the field-piece could be mounted. This
last was done during the night, and all was made ready
for demolishing the fortified place in the morning; but
the enemy, taking advantage of the darkness, had decamped
in the night. It was afterwards ascertained that
the bravest of the Kayans had been placed there, with strict
orders to hold the place against the advancing flotilla. All
the worst characters and principal leaders had been there too,
and among them Sawing, Sakalai, and Talip. The house
was now burnt, after having been rifled, and parties of Dayaks
were sent in all directions to destroy the villages of the
Kayans. Among the spoil taken was a Gusi jar valued
at £150. In all directions smoke arose, and at night the
flames could be seen leaping above the tree-tops from the
burning houses.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tuan Muda now pushed on and passed the Majawa
rapids.</p>

<p class='c000'>"When we had reached the upper end of the gorge
we could plainly survey the fall behind us—our force coming
up one by one, with dense masses of thousands on the rocks,
others wending an ant-like pilgrimage around the almost
perpendicular banks and ledges. Toes and fingers often
came in useful for clinging to every niche.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Above this point we again reached smooth and deep
water, running quietly. The crews were stopping and
plundering things thrown aside by the enemy as they retreated.
We pulled in untroubled waters for only an hour,
and then arrived at dangerous rocky places, gradually getting
steeper and steeper. The stream rushed past, and numbers
of the boats were damaged. Fortunately we had picked
up many native boats. The channels wound circuitously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>among very sharp rocks, over which we had to use ropes.
Sergeant Lee's boat was smashed, and he and his crew were
deposited on a rock for some hours. We came to for the
night in a bight, surrounded in every direction by rocks.
The leaders of our force lost one man here; as he was taking
out a rope, an enemy blew a poisoned arrow into his chest,
which knocked him down, when his head was cut off."</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 11th, the foot of the Makun rapid was reached.
But for some way below the great cataract the river eddies
and boils and plunges over rocks, and races between projecting
fangs and islets. Here for two hours they had to
toil with poles and ropes. The Makun rapid is a descent of
the river in one great slide, with swirls and whirlpools, and
with such force that it is only possible to ascend it, one boat
at a time, pulled by ropes, and with two or three in her
punting to control her movements, and prevent her being
stove in against the rocks.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ascent was begun on the 11th, and successfully
accomplished. But fifteen boats were lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I resolved to push on with the force we had, viz. 150
Malays and about 100 Dyak boats. Watson and Stuart
were now boatless, and they also had to harbour in Fitz's
boat, which had become the refuge of the destitute. A
satisfaction prevails at having overcome the greatest obstacle
in the approach to the Kayan confines. We proceeded
about five miles, and towards evening received news that
some captives had been taken. The enemy held nowhere
and were pursued like sheep. I at once decided to go no
farther, as our work of destruction would serve as a sufficient
punishment for these people, who have proved themselves
a most dastardly set of cowards, running on every occasion,
leaving their children and women at the mercy of the Dyaks.
These stupid inhabitants trusted to the superstitious traditions
of their forefathers to guard them without the help of man,
and now awakened to the mistake of their impregnability,
too late. They resorted to their heels on every occasion;
and two young boys yesterday chased up a hill two men
equal to the boys in arms, both parties having swords only.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Our warlike munitions have been useless, and the gun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>only employed in firing twenty-one rounds on the bank in
the afternoon. A boat arrived this morning, bringing three
captives, one of whom I determined to leave on the bank
to take a message, after we had left, to Oyong Hang. At
sunset we collected the few chiefs, and the captive, a middle-aged
woman, was brought before us. I told her, by means
of an interpreter, that we attacked their country, because
they had taken part against our friends and the subjects of
Sarawak, and had harboured the three chief murderers of
Messrs. Fox and Steele, named Sakalai, Sawing, and Talip.
Whoever befriended them must necessarily become our
enemies; besides, they had made several attacks on the Dyaks.
I gave her a 12-pounder shot and a Sarawak flag, which were
to be presented to Oyong Hang for him to make his choice.
The latter was an emblem of peace, which would provide
him with a safe-conduct to Kanowit, in order to open peaceful
relations. The shot was an emblem of war, which we
should conclude he had accepted if he did not shortly make
his appearance with the flag. All attacks by Dyaks would
be forbidden for the present, as it was our desire to be on
friendly terms.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Dyak from whom I took the captive complained
bitterly, and said he had lost a mother and sister, killed by
the Kayans, and now wanted her (head) in exchange. I
gave them to understand plainly that whoever touched her
would suffer death.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>13th and 14th.</em>—We waited for loiterers, who provoked
me by their dilatoriness. Some had been wounded by
poisoned arrows, but the only effect was feverishness. A few
had ghastly wounds from spears. There had been more
dreadful sights in this campaign than I had bargained for.
Many women and children even had been killed by our
people, who state, with some degree of truth, that in their
excitement they had mistaken them for men, as they wore
head-dresses similar to the dress of the men in this country.
I resolved on any future occasion when I should have to
call out the Dyaks, that a heavy fine should be imposed
on any one perpetrating such acts. Still, at present, they can
scarcely be expected to comprehend such a rule, as many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>are now thirsting for revenge, smarting under the loss of
wives, mothers, and sisters, mercilessly tortured and killed by
the Kayans, who have always been in the habit of practising
the blackest treachery and making sudden attacks when
professing the staunchest friendship.</p>

<p class='c000'>"On looking over our force, and counting those passing, I
calculated that we must number five hundred large boats,
containing about fifteen thousand men—Dyaks of some
twenty different branch tribes, who had mostly been each
other's enemies in former times."</p>

<p class='c000'>On the return of the expedition, Kanowit was reached
on the 17th, and thence the Tuan Muda went back to his
station at Sekrang, and waited there for nearly a month
before a deputation of Kayans arrived, bearing the flag that
had been left with the captive woman. They numbered
seventy men, and came to profess their desire for peace
in the future. They reported that their chief Oyong Hang
had summoned the people to a conference, and then and
there had cut down Talip, and his followers had put Sakalai
to death, but Sawing, suspecting what would be the determination
of the Kayans, had escaped a few days previously.<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c011'><sup>[286]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly the month of August was appointed for
the gathering of a large assembly of the tribes to conclude
a peace with the Kayans. There were, however, several
hitches, and the meeting did not take place until October.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Kayan peace was concluded this month, when the
chiefs arrived at Kanowit for that purpose. They met the
Dyaks, and a pig was killed, according to custom. The terms
and points to be sacredly attended to were all discussed
before the Resident of the place. Some of the chiefs of the
Keniah country were also present, and expressed a desire
for trade and friendship. They talked of removing down
the river. At this meeting there were representatives of
25,000 souls, who were all strangers to us, although living
within the limits of Sarawak territory. This peace had been
the great event of the year 1863, and leaves Sarawak
without an enemy in her dominions, and without an intertribal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>war of any description. This is the first time the
country has had peace."</p>

<p class='c000'>In December, Sawing, the last of the murderers of Fox
and Steele, was given up, tried, and executed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And now," says the Tuan Muda, "the deaths of those
who were private friends and public servants, and who had
occupied a distant and isolated out-station, have been
completely avenged."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah remained in Sarawak till after the subjection
of the Kayans, and then, having handed over the Government
to the Tuan Muda, left in September, 1863, and "bade farewell
to the people and the country he was never to see
again."</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>THE RAJAH'S TOMB.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We are drawing
near to the close
of the first stage
in the History
of Sarawak. It
had opened with great
hopes. To his mother
the Rajah had written in 1841:
"I trust there may be marked
out for me a more useful existence,
that will enable me to lay my head
on my pillow and say that I have
done something to better the condition of my kind, and to
deserve their applause," and again, "I hope that thousands
will be benefited when I am mouldering in dust," and these
hopes have been fulfilled. But the last period of the Rajah's
life was clouded with sorrow, disappointment, and pecuniary
anxieties.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had practically given up the government in 1863,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>though he reigned for five years longer, and could make his
will felt when need be. His health had broken down, and
he wrote on May 29, 1863: "I cannot stand the climate
and work," and in that year he left Sarawak for good, having
installed his nephew, the Tuan Muda, as administrator. He
was then only sixty, but for over twenty years his life had
been full of anxiety, and had been a continual struggle against
adversities, the most serious caused by the "malignant and
persevering persecutions"<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c011'><sup>[287]</sup></a> of his own countrymen, to whom
he had turned for a little sympathy and a little help, which
would have cost England nothing. In his policy and his
actions he had been guided by no personal ambition; the
great desire of his heart had been throughout the extension
of British influence in the Far East, the improvement of
trade, the suppression of piracy, the horrors of which he had
witnessed, and the amelioration of the lot of the oppressed
and suffering natives, whom he had come to love and esteem
for their many good qualities.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to the other countries included in the general
policy of the Rajah, this book has little to do. It suffices to
note that had that policy not been discredited, Siam,<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c011'><sup>[288]</sup></a> the
Sulu archipelago, the whole of New Guinea, and a greater part
of Borneo might now have been under British influence. To
the Rajah's unaided efforts, frowned upon at home, England
owes it that Sarawak, Bruni, and Labuan are not now Dutch
Residencies, and North Borneo, through conquest from the
Spaniards, an American colony.</p>

<p class='c000'>By his enterprise Sarawak, weakened by civil war and
oppression, was converted into an independent and cogent
State, and became a check upon any further advance of the
Dutch northwards; and their strong diplomatic objections
to the Rajah's presence in Sarawak shows what they had in
view. Moreover, the treaty he effected with the Sultan of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Bruni in 1847 effectually prevented any settlements other
than of an English character being established in northern
Borneo.</p>

<p class='c000'>From southern Borneo England had retired in favour
of the Dutch, and, previous to this, after the disaster of
Balambangan, and its withdrawal from Bruni, had ceased
to take any further interest in northern Borneo, nor was any
attempt made to re-establish its prestige there, or to suppress
piracy, even after Singapore had been founded in 1819.
As usual, England had to wait for a man of action and
resolution, and twenty years afterwards, though, fortunately,
when not too late, he appeared in the person of the late
Rajah. Such a man also was Sir Stamford Raffles, who
saved Singapore and the Malay peninsula to England. It
is almost a parallel case.</p>

<p class='c013'>The members of the East India Board were furious, and the
Ministers of the Crown were "excessively angry." Indeed had it
not been for Raffles ... it is certain that Singapore would have
been abandoned by the British. Raffles made it, and Raffles saved
it.... Raffles' genius and patriotism were rewarded by endless
worry, by the disapproval of his employers, and by public censure
from his country's Ministers.<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c011'><sup>[289]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>But the Rajah abandoned the larger policy as hopeless,
and devoted his life and his means to his adopted country;
and here the British Government, influenced by Gladstone,
Cobden, Sidney Herbert, and their Little England followers,
did its best to paralyse his efforts.</p>

<p class='c013'>"My duty has been done at any cost," he wrote sadly, "and the
British Government will be responsible for the consequences which
must follow upon its abandonment of Sarawak. I do not mention
the treatment I have personally received at its hands, for I seek no
favour, nor expect justice, and I shall close a troubled career with
the conviction that it might have been useful to my country and
honourable to myself and a blessing to the native race, but for
the indifference, the inconstancy, and, I regret to say, the injustice
of the British Government."<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c011'><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In an introduction to his nephew the Tuan Muda's <cite>Ten
Years in Sarawak</cite>, written in January 1866, he expressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>what had been the ambition of his life, and his disappointment
at its nonfulfilment.</p>

<p class='c013'>I once had a day-dream of advancing the Malayan race by enforcing
order and establishing self-government among them; and I
dreamed too that my native country would desire the benefit of
position, influence, and commerce, without the responsibilities from
which she shrinks. But the dream ended with the first waking
reality, and I found how true it is, that nations are like men, that
the young hope more than they fear, and the old fear more than
they hope—that England had ceased to be enterprising, and could
not look forward to obtaining great ends by small means perseveringly
applied, and that the dependencies are not now regarded as a field
of outlay, to yield abundant national returns, but as a source of
wasteful expenditure to be wholly cut off. The cost ultimately may
verify the old adage, and some day England may wake from the
dream of disastrous economy, as I have awakened from my dreams
of extended usefulness. I trust the consequences may not be more
hurtful to her than they have been to me.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since this, I have found happiness in advancing the happiness
of my people, who, whatever may be their faults, have been true to
me and mine through good report and evil report, through prosperity
and through misfortune.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the very commencement of his career in Borneo he
had invited the support of the British Government "to relieve
an industrious people from oppression, and to check, and if
possible, to suppress piracy and the slave trade." He was
anxious to see a British Settlement established, under the
direction of others if necessary, and he was prepared to
transfer his rights and interests to any successor. He looked
upon himself in the light of "an agent whom fortune had
enabled to open the path," and he felt "if a case of misery
ever called for help, it is here, and the act of humanity which
redeems the Dayak race<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c011'><sup>[291]</sup></a> from the condition of unparalleled
wretchedness will open a path for religion, and for commerce,
which may in future repay the charity which ought to seek
for no remuneration." His wish had always been that the
country should be taken under the wing of England, and,
though he at first justly asked that what he had sunk
into it of his own private fortune should be repaid him,
he was finally prepared to waive this consideration if only
England would adopt the struggling little State. Failing
this, he desired that the British Government would extend
a protectorate over the State, so that capitalists should
be encouraged to invest money for the development of
its resources. But even recognition of Sarawak as an
independent State was not granted till 1863. Protection
was not accorded till 1888, and then it was offered, not
asked for, and was granted, not in the interests of Sarawak,
but for the safeguarding of Imperial interests, lest some other
foreign power should lay its hands on the little State.</p>

<p>KUCHING (UPPER PART).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Recognition, for which the Rajah had striven for so many
years, being at last granted, filled him with the greatest
satisfaction. But considering the past history of Sarawak,
and bearing in mind how well that country has since done
without extraneous aid, it would seem to have been a pity
that Sarawak ever attracted the attention of England, and
that the Rajah ever sought for encouragement or protection
there. Sarawak has stood the test of nearly seventy years
as an independent State, and continues its prosperous career,
without owing anything to any one, and requiring only to be
let alone. But financial troubles had overtaken the State
in the latter days of the Rajah, and to him these were an
endless source of worry and anxiety. From 1863, to the
time of his death in 1868, his letters to his representative
in Sarawak, the Tuan Muda, were almost always on this
subject. To matters relating to general policy, there is in
them little reference to be found; though throughout they
express constant forebodings in regard to the future of the
raj. "Alone, burdened with debts, with few friends and
many foes, how are you to stand without support," he wrote
to the Tuan Muda; the last years of his life were clouded
by a dread of evils, for he placed too much weight on public
opinion, which was generally as erroneous as it was inimical.<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c011'><sup>[292]</sup></a>
In 1863, the whole responsibility was thrown upon the present
Rajah's shoulders, to whom it was left to find a way to
establish the revenue on a sound basis, and to reduce a large
debt without sacrificing efficiency. The Government under
the present Rajah practically commenced in that year.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>Sir Spenser St. John says, in his <cite>Rajah Brooke</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c013'>"In the autumn of 1866 he (the Rajah) received a severe shock.
His nephew, the Tuan Muda, wrote that he had sold the steamer
<em>Rainbow</em> to pay off a debt due to their Singapore agent—a debt
incurred through careless extravagance in carrying out his many
public works at a time when funds were scarce. For a moment it
almost stupefied him, as this steamer had not yet been paid for,"
and "Sarawak without a steamer, he felt assured, would sink back
into its old state of insecurity; and therefore another steamer must
be had. By great exertion, he succeeded in raising the necessary
funds, and purchased a vessel which was christened the <em>Royalist</em>."</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Spenser must have trusted to his memory, which
played him false. The Sarawak Government had then
another and a larger steamer, the <em>Heartsease</em>,<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c011'><sup>[293]</sup></a> and the Rajah
was having the <em>Royalist</em><a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c011'><sup>[294]</sup></a> built in England to carry mails
and merchandise to and from Singapore. He was consulted
about the sale of the <em>Rainbow</em> and sanctioned it, for he wrote
to the Tuan Muda on March 6, 1865, "We are quite agreed
as to the advisability of selling the <em>Rainbow</em>," the purchase
money to go towards paying for the new vessel he was
having built. The Singapore agents were instructed to
remit the money home, but, without the knowledge of the
Tuan Muda, kept it to cover an over-draft. This over-draft
was not incurred to pay expenses of public works, but for
absolute necessaries. The Rajah had but little trouble to
raise the balance due on the <em>Royalist</em>; and even this was
not necessary, for a Singapore Bank at once advanced an
amount equivalent to the balance due on the <em>Rainbow</em>, which
was remitted to England.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Burrator, his little out-of-the-world Devonshire seat,
on the edge of the moors, the Rajah was perfectly happy
so long as not troubled with bad news from Sarawak. He
devoted himself to the country-side folk, who were greatly
attached to him. His life was one simple and contented;
he enjoyed the exceeding quietude, and he was happy
in trying to make others happy. Riding and shooting, so
long as his health permitted, were his amusements, parish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>affairs, and the improvement of his little property, his chief
interests.</p>

<p class='c000'>The longing to return to his people was strong upon
him. But, as time advanced and his strength diminished,
he foresaw that what had become the desire of his life would
be denied him. Some three years before his death he wrote
to the Tuan Muda, "Farewell, think of me as well content,
free from anxiety, and watching your progress with pride
and pleasure."</p>

<p class='c000'>Largely assisted by the late Sir Massey Lopes, who
owned the land in the parish, he "restored" the Parish
Church, and was instrumental in a new school being provided.
The church contained a magnificent rood-screen, richly
carved and gilt, extending across the nave and aisle; indeed
it was the finest specimen in that part of the county. Unhappily
neither the Rajah nor Sir Massey could appreciate
its artistic and antiquarian value, and it was ruthlessly swept
away. No architect was employed, only a local builder, and
the new work done in the church is as bad as can be
conceived, such as was likely to proceed from the designs of
a common ignorant builder.</p>

<p class='c000'>On June 11, 1868, Sir James Brooke died at Burrator,
leaving the succession of the raj to his nephew Charles
Brooke, and his male issue, failing such to his nephew H.
Stuart Johnson and his male issue. In default of such
issue, the Rajah devised his said sovereignty, "The rights,
privileges, and power thereto belonging, unto her Majesty
the Queen of England, her heirs and assigns for ever."</p>

<p class='c000'>He was buried in the churchyard at Sheepstor, and a
memorial window to him has been placed in the church.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. A. Russel Wallace, in <cite>The Malay Archipelago</cite>,
1869, says:—</p>

<p class='c013'>That his Government still continues after twenty years, notwithstanding
frequent absences from ill health, notwithstanding conspiracies
of Malay chiefs, and insurrections of Chinese gold-diggers, all of
which have been overcome by the support of the native population,
and notwithstanding financial, political, and domestic troubles—is
due, I believe, solely to many admirable qualities which Sir James
Brooke possessed, and especially to his having convinced the native
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>population, by every action of his life, that he ruled them, not for his
own advantage, but for their good.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since these lines were written, his noble spirit has passed away.
But, though by those who knew him not, he may be sneered at as
an enthusiast, adventurer, or abused as a hard-headed despot, the
universal testimony of every one who came in contact with him in
his adopted country, whether European, Malay, or Dayak, will be
that Rajah Brooke was a great, a wise, and a good ruler—a true
and faithful friend, a man to be admired for his talents, respected
for his honour and courage, and loved for his genuine hospitality,
his kindness of disposition, and his tenderness of heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>Writing in 1866, the old Rajah said of his nephew:—</p>

<p class='c013'>He is looked up to in that country (Sarawak) as the chief of all
the Sea-Dayaks, and his intimate knowledge of their language, their
customs, their feelings, and their habits far exceed that of any other
person. His task has been successfully accomplished of stamping
out the last efforts of piratical Malayan chiefs, and their supporters
among the Dayaks of Saribas, and of other countries. He first
gained over a portion of these Dayaks to the cause of order, and
then used them as his instruments in the same cause, to restrain
their countrymen. The result is that the coast of Sarawak is as
safe to the trader as the coast of England, and that an unarmed man
could traverse the country without let or hindrance. It is a great
gratification to me to acknowledge my nephew's devotion to the
cause to which my own life has been devoted. It is well that his
strength has come to supply my weakness, and that his energies and
his life (if needed) should be given to establish the governorship,
and promote the happiness of the people of Sarawak. My career
draws to its close, but I have confidence that no consideration will
turn him from the work which I shall leave for his hand to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>How deserved this trust was, has been made manifest
by the present Rajah's own life-long devotion to the interests
of the people he was ordained to govern. On his accession,
no change was made in the wise and liberal policy of his
predecessor. Only such reforms and improvements, administrative
or otherwise, consistent with that policy have been
made. Up to the time of the first Rajah's death, no great
progress commercially and financially had been effected,
and it was left to his successor to promote the commercial
and industrial advancement of the State. The Sea-Dayaks
and tribes of the interior still required a strong hand and a
watchful eye to keep them in order, and the subsequent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>large additions of territory entailed greater responsibility and
harder work.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the gradual establishment of a government suitable
to the country and its people, the main principles that have
guided the late and the present Rajah are—that the
natives should, through their chiefs, have a full though
subordinate share in its administration and its councils;
that their own laws and customs should be respected,
though modified where necessary in accordance with the first
principles of justice and humanity. That no sudden and
wholesale changes disquieting to the native mind should be
made, and that reforms should be very carefully considered
from both the white man's and the native's point of view
before being introduced, and that if carried out, it should be
done gradually. Thus, without giving rise to any opposition
or discontent, slavery, which was at one time in a cruel and
oppressive form, by a gradual process of ameliorating the
condition of the slaves, enlarging their privileges, reducing
the powers of owners and increasing their responsibilities,
in course of time ceased to be a profitable institution, and
died a natural death without any sudden and violent
legislation.</p>

<p class='c000'>How that was done will be shown in the following
chapter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Spartans a drunken helot was produced,
staggering and imbecile, to show the young into what a
disgraceful condition a man fell who gave way to liquor.
And in Borneo, in the Sultanate of Bruni, the people had
before their eyes a reminder of what was a bad, irresponsible
government.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old Rajah left behind him one of the noblest records
of a life devoted to the cause of humanity, and of a task
completed, which has been equalled by few men. His
motives, untarnished by any desire for honours or for worldly
advancement, were as pure as was his chivalry, which was
without reproach. No better man, and few greater, have
lived.</p>

<p class='c000'>That those who vainly sought by the degradation of his
position to enrich themselves should have turned round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>upon him, and have vilified a character whose humane and
lofty views were foreign to their own, is not so surprising as
that ministers and politicians of the highest repute should
have lent ready ears to their libellous and unfounded statements,
and have treated with a total absence of a spirit
of fair play a man whose policy and methods merited their
fullest recognition and support.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Charles
Brooke
was proclaimed
Rajah on
August 3, 1868, throughout the territory. The ceremony in
the capital and at the out-stations was simple. The people
were assembled, the proclamation read, and the Rajah's flag
saluted. He did not then take the oath, but this was administered
at the next meeting of the General Council, on
October 11, 1870, when the Rajah solemnly bound himself
to respect the religion, rights, privileges, and institutions of
the people; that no laws or customary laws would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>changed or modified without the sanction of the chiefs
assembled in Council, that he would uphold the late Rajah's
will in respect to the succession to the raj, that the people
should have a voice in the selection of their chiefs, and
that all cases arising amongst Muhammadans in respect to
marriage, divorce, and inheritance should be settled by the
Malay chiefs in accordance with Muhammadan law. At
this meeting of the Council the English and native members
took the oaths to endeavour to the best of their abilities to
advise truthfully and justly for the good of the country, and
to uphold the authority of the Rajah. This oath is administered
to every new member upon appointment.</p>

<p class='c000'>As has been mentioned, the Rajah had already been
ruling the State for five years previous to his accession, and,
though troubled with a few internal disorders among the
Dayaks in the far interior, the general peaceful state of the
country, which he had done so much to bring about, left
him free to devote more of his time and attention to many
needed improvements in the administration, and reforms in
certain customary laws, which could only be effected as time
smoothed out party feelings, racial jealousies and distrust,
and all had settled down tranquilly under a government
acceptable to the whole population, and which all were willing
to uphold. How the Rajah succeeded as a wise and tactful
administrator, the sure and steady advance of the country,
its revenue and trade sufficiently testify. Not only has this
been fully acknowledged by outside witnesses in a position
to judge, but, what he values more, has won the approbation
and confidence of his people.</p>

<p class='c000'>No one was in a better position to bear testimony to
this than the old Datu Bandar, Haji Bua Hasan, who, in
spite of evil report and good report, won the respect of all
classes. As already mentioned, he was a son of the gallant
Patinggi Ali, and was appointed Imaum when Haji Gapur
was degraded, and shortly afterwards was raised to the rank
of Datu. He held his rank and office for over sixty years,
and became the trusted friend of both Rajahs and of all
his "English brethren." This is the simple testimony he
bore on the opening of the new Court-house and public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>offices during the absence of the Rajah in England, acting
as he did as spokesman for his countrymen, and in the
presence of many hundreds of them.</p>

<p class='c013'>English brethren, datus, and people all at present within the
Court. I am happy in being here in company with you to hail
the anniversary of the Rajah's birthday, and to join with you in
opening this our new Court-house.</p>

<p class='c013'>I am here to bear testimony to the fostering care which the
Rajah has ever taken of his children; we, who in years gone by
were not only poor, but sunk under oppression, and heaviness of
heart, by his assistance have become rich, and our hearts have
waxed light within us under the blessing of freedom.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Rajah is but following out the good work begun by his
uncle in our regard many years ago.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Rajah, in succeeding his uncle, has not attempted to
suppress, to interfere with, or to decry our religion, therefore I say
to you all, follow that religion truly and adhere to its teachings.
Whoever there be who shall forget what the Rajah has achieved for
him and his, that man is not worthy to be accounted a friend of
the Government, but shall be looked upon as an enemy, and
whoever becomes an enemy of the constituted Government is an
offender also against the faith.</p>

<p class='c013'>How is it possible for any of us, remembering all that the
Rajah has done for our advancement, to go against him, or in any
way to oppose him. On the contrary, it is our duty—the duty of
all of us who subsist under the Government—to praise the Rajah,
to pray for long life for him and his, and beyond this to ask that
he may be blessed with fortune in his reign, so that we may long
live happy, as we are now, under him.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be advisable here to give some account of the
manner in which Sarawak has been and is still governed, in
regard to which Sir Spenser St. John, who was out in
Borneo, either in Sarawak or Bruni, for thirteen years, wrote
in 1899:</p>

<p class='c013'>The Government is a kind of mild despotism, the only government
suitable to Asiatics, who look to their chief as the sole
depositary of supreme power. The influence of the old Rajah still
pervades the whole system, and natives and Europeans work
together in perfect harmony.<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c011'><sup>[295]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>For administrative purposes the country is divided into
four Divisions, with a Resident of the 1st Class, or Divisional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>Resident, in charge of each, but of late years it has been
necessary to appoint only Divisional Residents to the 1st
Division, the smallest in area, but the most important, as
containing the capital; and to the 3rd Division, which
extending from Kalaka to Kedurong Point, takes in about
half the State, and contains about half the population. The
Divisions are divided into Residencies, under charge of
Residents of the 2nd Class, with Assistant Residents, and
junior officers under them, all under the supervision of the
Divisional Residents.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Kuching the Divisional Resident is assisted by a
Resident of the 2nd Class, and the executive work is under
the control of the usual departments, directed by the
Treasurer, Commandant, Commissioner of Public Works,
Postmaster-General, Magistrate Court of Requests, Superintendent
of Police, principal and junior Medical Officers,
Superintendent of Surveys, and Engineer in chief, with
English, Eurasians, Chinese, and native assistants. The
Rajah is the supreme judge, and the other judges of the
Supreme Court are the Divisional Residents, the Datu
Bandar, the Datu Hakim, and the Datu Imaum. These
also form the Supreme Council, with his Highness as
President. The Supreme Council, which was instituted by
the first Rajah, acting on the advice of Earl Grey, October
17, 1855, meets once a month for the consideration of all
important matters in connection with the welfare and
administration of the State. It is an established rule that
in this Council the European members shall not outnumber
the native members.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to the Supreme Council is the General
Council, or Council Negri (State Council), which was
instituted by the present Rajah in April, 1865, to
consolidate the Government by giving the native chiefs
more than local interest in the affairs of the State; to
impress them with a sense of responsibility; to establish
an uniformity of customs; and to promote a good feeling
amongst them, and confidence in each other. Before the
Council was inaugurated the chiefs seldom met one another,
and were almost strangers except in name. Those in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>provinces rarely visited the capital; they knew little about,
and took but a slight interest in public concerns not directly
affecting their own districts. The members of this Council
also form local, or Residency, Councils in their respective
districts, with the several Residents as vice-presidents.</p>

<p class='c000'>This General Council includes the above members of the
Supreme Council, the Residents of the 2nd Class, Treasurer,
Commandant, principal Medical Officer, and the leading
Malay, Dayak, and Kayan governing chiefs, as well as the
chiefs of other tribes, who have proved deserving of being
appointed members. It meets once every three years, and
at the last meeting, in 1906, there were present thirteen
(absent five) Europeans and thirty-six native members.
To quote from his Highness' speech made at that meeting:</p>

<p class='c013'>The General Council was organised for the purpose of settling
any serious question or dispute relating to the welfare of the country
whenever such questions should arise, ... and he thought it was
always a good thing that they should at least once in three years
meet each other, exchange thoughts and views, and renew
acquaintanceship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although it is the rule that the Council should meet at
least once in every three years, it is liable to be convened at
any time should any emergency arise, and this has been
done upon more than one occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus one was summoned in June, 1867,<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c011'><sup>[296]</sup></a> to meet at
Sibu, to discuss and decide upon the course to be pursued
to ensure protection for the lives and property of Sarawak
subjects trading in Bruni territory. A letter was drawn up
by the Rajah in Council to the Sultan, laying the facts
before him, and asking for justice and protection. This
drew from him the rude retort that "the Rajah he knew,
but the members of the Council he presumed were only his
coolies."</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor was this all. When the Rajah's principal Resident,
with some of the leading members of the Council, visited
Bruni, the Sultan refused to allow the latter into his
presence, but relegated them to an outer chamber with
persons of low rank.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>Hitherto the Sarawak chiefs of all ranks and races had
entertained a lingering sympathy and respect for the "Iang
de Pertuan" (He that rules), the Sultan's more correct
title, but these insults completely alienated their regard.</p>

<p class='c000'>The details of administration in the out-stations are
many and diversified, and in some of the districts entail a
considerable amount of travelling. The Resident is the
chief judicial officer in his district. He is responsible for
the proper collection of the revenue and for the expenditure.
The public works, the police, in fact the general conduct
of affairs throughout his district, are under his supervision,
and he has to be continually visiting the outlying villages.
Usually there is an Assistant Resident and one or more
junior officers to assist him. Besides his usual routine
work, he must at all times be accessible to natives of all
races and of all degrees. Though irksome at times, this
duty is one of considerable importance. Some come to
complain against decisions of their chiefs; some for advice
and assistance; and some seek an interview under a trivial
pretext, behind which, however, may be important news,
which they would hesitate to deliver before others. The
natives are the eyes and ears of a Resident, and through
them alone can he derive early intelligence of the doings
and intentions of his people. And not a less important
duty is to become thoroughly acquainted with the people
under his care, to keep in close personal touch with them,
and to become conversant with their customs and ideas, for
the law he administers must be made more or less consonant
with these. Customs inconsistent with justice and common
sense have long since been discarded for more enlightened
rules, but those conformable to these principles, and suitable
to the conditions of the people, have become recognised
customary laws, and these vary among the different races.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the settlement of divorce and probate cases among
the Muhammadans, Courts have been established throughout
the State. In Kuching the Court is presided over by the
datus, those in the out-stations by the Malay Government
chiefs, who also sit as magistrates in the Residency Courts.
Such cases are settled in accordance with Muhammadan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>law, modified as the Supreme Council may see fit, and
subject to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beside the permanent and salaried native officers, every
Malay and Melanau village has its tuah,<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c011'><sup>[297]</sup></a> or chief, who is
elected by the people, and, if the selection is approved by
the Government, he receives a commission from the Rajah,
appointing him chief for a term of three years. These
tuahs are responsible for the collection of dues and taxes,
and have power as sub-magistrates to settle small cases.
As a rule they are remunerated by commissions, though
some receive salaries.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sea-Dayaks, Kayans, and Kenyahs have district-chiefs,
as already stated, called pengulus, who are appointed
by the Government; and each house or village has its
recognised sub-chief. The powers and duties of the
pengulus are similar to those of the Malay tuahs, and
they are similarly remunerated.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1872, certain criticisms upon the administration
drew forth a rejoinder which appeared in the <cite>Sarawak
Gazette</cite> of September 2, and as it so clearly lays down
the Rajah's opinions and his policy we give it in full:</p>

<p class='c013'>It is easy enough to find weak places in any system, and to
give it credit on the whole for less than it deserves, because we
disapprove of it in part. It is as easy, especially if one has played
an important part in it oneself, to over-estimate its benefits. But
in a semi-barbarous country, governed in conjunction with the old
native authorities by a knot of foreigners, who are in advance of
those they govern in knowledge and experience, it is hardest of all
to judge impartially what has been done or is in progress. There
are two widely different principles on which such a country can
be judged; we will call them the Native and the European principle
respectively. The first regards the old condition of things,
established by custom and the character of race, as essentially
natural, and is more or less adverse from changes, however slight,
in what has these important sanctions. The second places the
standard of Western civilisation before it, and is apt to judge rather
harshly whatever falls far short of this, or is not, at least, in a fair
way towards attaining it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The common mistake Europeans make in the East is to exalt
the latter of these principles almost to the exclusion of the other,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>instead of using them as mutually corrective. And this mistake
has its origin, not in reasoning or in justice, but in the imperious
spirit which makes white men in the East believe themselves lords
of creation, and their darker brethren kindly provided in more or
less abundance for their profit and advantage. At any rate no
man in his senses can expect a wilderness of barbarism to blossom
like a rose in a day, or a perfect government to appear full grown
at once; while it is as unjust to put the traditions of the natives
and their social position out of the question and consult European
notions only, as it is debasing to lower ourselves to the level of
native ignorance and stolidity.</p>

<p class='c013'>In accordance with these two principles, there are two ways in
which a government can act. The first is to start from things as
we find them, putting its veto on what is dangerous or unjust, and
supporting what is fair and equitable in the usages of the natives,
and letting system and legislation wait upon occasion. When new
wants are felt it examines and provides for them by measures
rather made on the spot than imported from abroad; and, to
ensure that these shall not be contrary to native customs, the
consent of the people is gained for them before they are put in
force.</p>

<p class='c013'>The white man's so-called privilege of class is made little of,
and the rules of government are framed with greater care for the
interests of the majority who are not Europeans than for those of
the minority of superior race. Progress in this way is usually slow,
and the system is not altogether popular from our point of view;
but it is both quiet and steady; confidence is increased; and no
vision of a foreign yoke to be laid heavily on their shoulders, when
the opportunity offers, is present to the native mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other plan is to make here and there a clean sweep and
introduce something that Europeans like better, in the gap. A
criminal code of the latest type, polished and revised by the wise
men at home, or a system of taxation and police introduced boldly
from the West is imposed, with a full assurance of its intrinsic
excellence, but with too little thought of how far it is likely to suit
the circumstances it has to meet.</p>

<p class='c013'>We care not to set the two principles in stronger contrast, or
apply either to the policy which prevails here, only when men set
themselves to be critics their first business is to rate themselves at
their proper level in the community, and remember that their own
interest is not all that has to be considered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The policy of ingrafting western methods on eastern
customs by a gradual and gentle process has been attended
not only with marked success but with appreciation by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>natives themselves. It has been the means by which old
prejudices have been broken down, and reforms in laws and
administration have step by step, and without friction or
difficulty, been substituted for unjust and debasing customs.
By preserving old customs good in themselves, modifying
these where necessary, avoiding sudden and drastic changes,
and, above all, by acting in conjunction with the native
chiefs and in sympathy with their ideas, a faith in the
integrity of the purpose of their white Ruler has been
instilled into the minds of the people, and a feeling that
whatever change he may advise will be primarily for their
benefit.</p>

<p class='c013'>I do not exaggerate, the Rajah wrote in 1870, when I say
our chief success has been owing to the good feeling existing
between the Ruler and people, brought about by there being no
impediments between them; and that the non-success of European
governments generally in ruling Asiatics is caused by the want of
sympathy and knowledge between the Rulers and the ruled, the reason
being the distance and unapproachableness of the Leader. If I
were to exclude myself from Court I must necessarily withdraw
myself from hearing the complaints, either serious or petty, of my
people, who would then be justified in drawing an unsatisfactory
and unhappy comparison between myself and my uncle, who was
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i> the slave of the people, and left the country under <em>my</em>
charge expecting me to carry out <em>his</em> policy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Changes in laws and customs, which a few decades back
would have been viewed with sullen distrust, are now readily
accepted by the Malay chiefs, even those affecting their own
strict religious laws. These as enacted by Muhammad
were adjusted to meet the requirements of the past, but the
Malay chiefs have so far advanced in their ideas that they are
ready to admit that some of these laws may no longer be in
accordance with present conditions. So by an Act passed
in the Supreme Council an important rule contained in
that code regulating the succession to property was modified
as being opposed to modern ideas of fairness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before his accession, the Rajah had thoroughly gone
into the question of slavery; in this matter he invited
the opinions of all, and on his accession he was enabled to
promulgate certain laws affecting the slaves, that met with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>general approval. By these laws, the slave was protected
against ill-usage. He was granted civil rights, and the
privilege of freeing himself by the payment of a small
amount, the maximum price being fixed at about £7, an
amount which could easily be earned by a few months'
hard work. The transfer of slaves from one master to
another could be made only in, and with the consent of
the Courts. No slaves could be sold out of the country, and
no fresh slaves might be imported. To quote the <cite>Sarawak
Gazette</cite> of December 12, 1872:</p>

<p class='c013'>Before the arrival of Sir James Brooke, the Illanuns and other
pirates from North Borneo took yearly trips around the island,
making midnight attacks on peaceful villages, killing old men and
children, separating mother and child, husband and wife, and
carrying away hundreds of miserable wretches to be sold into
slavery in the Sulu archipelago.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Sarawak territory, Kayans and Melanaus sacrificed slaves
to propitiate evil spirits. To ensure good luck to a chief's new
house, the first post was driven through the body of a young
virgin. When they were afflicted with epidemics, it was the
custom to sacrifice a young girl by placing her in a canoe, and
allowing her to drift out to sea with the ebb tide. At the death of
a chief, slaves were tied to posts near the coffin of the deceased
and starved to death, in order that they might be ready to act as
attendants on their master in another world.<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c011'><sup>[298]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>These and a host of other atrocities were formerly enacted
here. Amongst the Malays was found slavery of a milder form.
Masters and slaves were, as a rule, on amicable terms, and the latter
were well treated. Where, however, there was no law, and
masters held absolute power over their slaves,<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c011'><sup>[299]</sup></a> ill-usage
occasionally followed as a consequence; and we could fill pages
with stories of cruelties practised by Malay slave-holders in olden
days.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now on our coast piracy is a thing of the past. Inland, the
barbarities we have described are no longer practised by wild and
superstitious tribes; and although slavery is tolerated amongst the
Malays, it is in such a mild form that the word is a misnomer.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Government protects the bondman against cruelty and
ill-usage, and acknowledges his legal rights. He can now obtain
justice in the Courts, and by a wise regulation of the Government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>he can purchase his freedom at a fixed moderate price, so that should
he find his bondage irksome, he has an opportunity of freeing himself
by energy and hard work.</p>

<p class='c013'>The result is that the number of slaves in the territory is
steadily decreasing. Some of the Malays have been known to
emancipate their slaves at their death. Those who are now
nominally slaves are treated so well by their masters that they are
probably happier and better off than they would be as free
men.</p>

<p class='c000'>One great cause for the reduction in the number of
slaves was that, knowing their masters no longer had
power to drive them, and were bound to support them,
whether they worked or not, they became lazy and
unprofitable to their owners, who eventually found paid
labour to be far cheaper, and were only too glad to be rid
of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>These regulations gave the death-blow to slavery. It
now practically remained to the slaves themselves to
choose whether they should change their condition or not;
for energy on the part of a slave would enable him to
procure the price of his freedom, as well as that of his wife
and children, and that could no longer be arbitrarily fixed
or refused by his owner; or by contracting his labour he
could obtain an advance for this purpose. By degrees
many availed themselves of this advantage, though others
preferred to remain in a state of dependency. They were
well provided for, there was no necessity to work too hard,
and proper treatment was secured to them. Thus it came
to pass that many owners lost their diligent slaves, and were
left with the lazy and useless ones, who became an
expensive nuisance. Their wives and children, however,
remained slaves, as did those of men too infirm to work, but
of these, too, boys freed themselves as they grew up, and
girls by contracting marriages with freemen, and these could
free their parents. But the Rajah was desirous of abolishing
an institution that, though it was becoming one in name
only, still remained a blot upon the country, and in this he
had the support of the Malay chiefs, which many showed
in a practical manner by publicly and unconditionally
manumitting all their slaves. Having before prepared the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>minds of the people for the great social change he wished
to effect by bringing before the members of the General
Council a proposal to abolish slavery, in 1883 he brought
forward a bill for the gradual manumission of the slaves
during the next five years, and for the abolition of slavery
at the end of that period. But it became unnecessary to
proceed to an enactment, for in 1886 domestic slavery had
practically become a thing of the past, and at a meeting of
the Council in that year the Rajah withdrew the bill.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the relations with Bruni, we shall deal with them
in a special chapter. These relations, and those with the
Netherlands Government, comprise the whole of Sarawak
foreign policy, and the latter have of late years been
conducted in a friendly spirit of co-operation in the mutual
interests of the two countries, without undue and restrictive
formality and red-tapeism—a marked contrast to the
relations with Singapore, which has ever been jealous of
Sarawak.</p>

<p class='c000'>The relations with the Dutch had not, however, always
been friendly, for on two occasions they had seized Sarawak
trading prahus on the idle pretext of these being pirates.
The second time was as late as 1865, and then two
Sarawak and a Bruni prahu were seized in company by a
Dutch gunboat and towed into Sinkawang, where their
crew were placed in prison in irons, and the vessels and
cargoes confiscated. This drew a strong protest from the
Sarawak Government, and after some detention vessels and
crews were released, but without considerable portions of
their cargoes. Heavy damages were claimed, but never paid,
though the seizure was admitted to be wrongful.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was a poor return for the relief Sarawak had
afforded the Dutch coast, both from the ravages of the
Dayaks of Saribas and Sekrang, and the pirates from the
north. Before the action off Bintulu in 1862, the Dutch
had been unable effectually to protect their own coasts, the
many captives from Dutch Borneo then rescued being a
sufficient proof of this, but after that action the pirates did
not venture to pass Sarawak again, and the north-western
and western coasts were freed from their visits. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>action of the Dutch in seizing these prahus was the severest
blow Sarawak trade had suffered for many years; the fast-sailing
prahus might out-sail the pirates, or the well-armed
ones beat them off, but from men-of-war steamers there was
no escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah has from his accession kept a strict supervision
over all, even the smallest details of revenue and
expenditure; all accounts of the Treasury and out-stations
are submitted to him monthly, and no extra expenses
beyond those provided for by his orders may be incurred by
any department or in any out-station without his express
sanction. His guiding principle has always been the
strictest economy within limitations necessary to ensure
efficiency. Upon his accession the public debt amounted
to about £15,000, a considerable sum, with a revenue of
only little over $100,000; this was exclusive of what had
been sunk by the late Rajah—the whole of his fortune,
which Sir Spenser St. John is wrong in saying stands to
the credit of the Brooke family in the Treasury. In
1870 the revenue was $122,842, in 1907, $1,441,195,
with a large surplus, and no public debt.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the supervision of the Treasury, the Military,
Naval, and Public Works departments are under the direct
control of the Rajah, his daily routine in Kuching includes
visits to the barracks, to the steamers and engineer's workshop,
and to the jail, all which would be the work of the early
mornings and evenings. The Rajah also presides in the
Supreme and in the Police Courts, hearing and settling all
cases and receiving petitions, and listening to complaints after
the cases are disposed of; seeing all, whoever they are, and
whatever their occasion. After Court he visits the offices of
the various heads of departments, and attends to any business
they may have to bring before him. This is also done when
he visits out-stations, and in the absence of the Rajah the
same rule is observed by the Rajah Muda.</p>

<p class='c000'>But little had been done by the first Rajah towards promoting
the commercial and industrial development of the
State. He had, indeed, induced the Baroness Burdett Coutts
to start an experimental farm with paddy-working mills at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>Lundu, and an experimental garden near Kuching, to teach
the natives a better system of farming, with the use of the
plough, and to introduce new products. But she had been unfortunate
in the selection of managers; the experiments
proved failures, and were abandoned in 1872.</p>

<p class='c000'>Agriculture, the mainstay of all tropical countries,
chiefly occupied the present Rajah's mind, but to quote from
a speech made by him a few years after his accession:—</p>

<p class='c013'>I do not flatter myself when I say that I have tried my best
to advance agriculture, but I have most signally failed, and am,
in consequence, much disappointed. Nevertheless, I still entertain
hopes that the time for its development is not far distant, and
I am prepared to take any pains, to receive any amount of
advice, and to undergo any trouble if only I can see my way to
successfully spread gardens and plantations in the place of our vast
jungles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many schemes to promote this industry had been
attempted, and had failed; but the Rajah never lost sight of
his purpose, and how he was ultimately rewarded with success
a reference to the chapter dealing with agriculture will
show.</p>

<p class='c000'>We shall now notice the disturbances that occurred in
the period 1868-70.</p>

<p class='c000'>In July, 1868, the Rajah led an expedition against the
Delok Dayaks living in the Upper Batang Lupar for causing
trouble over the borders, and another in May, 1870, against
the Beloh Dayaks in the Katibas for the same reason. The
Katibas, who had hitherto been supporters of the Government,
had been led astray by the chief Balang<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c011'><sup>[300]</sup></a> in 1866, who then
laid a well-planned trap to get the Resident, Mr. J. B.
Cruickshank, into his hands to murder him. He was
captured by the Rajah, and taken to Sibu, where he was
executed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both these expeditions were successful, but no particulars
of either are to hand. These expeditions, however, did not
result in a final settlement of these disturbed remote districts.
The Dayaks submitted, only to break out again, and the lesson
had to be repeated several times. It will not be necessary or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>expedient to give an account of each of these. There is a
tragic monotony about them—so many villages burnt, so
many casualties to the punitive force, so many of the turbulent
natives killed, and then a hollow peace patched up between
the tribes concerned, with the usual ceremonies of killing of
pigs.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sea-Dayaks still required to be watched and controlled,
and "it would be strange if the Government had not
met with difficulties in keeping in subjection 160,000<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c011'><sup>[301]</sup></a> wild
Dayaks, all possessing energetic souls for warfare." The
Saribas, the most troublesome and toughest in holding
out, eventually settled down into the most peaceful and
law-abiding of the tribes, and became great traders, and
thoroughly loyal. This was the case as far back as 1865, and
in that year the present Rajah was able to write: "What an
altered country is Saribas to what it was a few years ago.
People are so quiet and peaceably disposed there now, that
never a word of head-hunting is breathed." And the same
may be said of the Sekrangs, who, with the exception of
one lapse, caused by the falsehood and treachery of a
once trusted chief, have remained true and faithful to the
Government that had brought them into subjection. And
in regard to all the Sea-Dayak tribes, then as now, it should
be borne in mind that their uprisings, though bringing them
into conflict with it, are never directed against the Government,
with the above exception only, which is related in
Chapter XIV. Like the Highlanders of yore, we may class
the various tribes of the Dayaks having a community of
language and customs as clans spasmodically at feud with
one another; and their feuds are confined to the far
interior of the State.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the evening of November 28, 1868, the Resident
at Muka, Captain W. H. Rodway,<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c011'><sup>[302]</sup></a> and Mr. E. Sinclair<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c011'><sup>[303]</sup></a>
went for a walk to the mouth of the river, distant some two
miles, leaving the fort in charge of the Sepoy Sergeant of
the guard. That morning a Malay named Ganti, an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>ex-fort-man, had been sentenced to five years' imprisonment
for a serious crime. He at once formed a plan with the
other prisoners to rush the fort and effect their escape; and
the culpable carelessness of the Sepoy guard soon gave
them their opportunity. At 5 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> the prisoners were
brought back from their work, and noticing that the whole
of the guard, with the exception of the sentry, were outside
the fort variously employed in the cookhouse, at the bathing
place, etc., they walked in and closed the doors, whilst Ganti,
who on a plea of sickness had been allowed by the Sergeant
to leave his cell in the basement and sit on the floor above
under the charge of the sentry, with a handspike killed the
sentry. A Mr. Bain, a former employe of the Borneo
Company, who was then a trader at Oya, and was at the
time ill in the fort, was murdered in his bed by a Chinaman,
whom he had imprisoned for debt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Resident hurried back to find that the fort with
guns and ammunition were in the hands of the prisoners,
who were firing at the natives, and whose position was
impregnable. Nothing could be done but to send for help
from Bintulu. The prisoners amused themselves with firing
at the surrounding houses, but their aim was so badly
directed that they did no harm to life, and but little to
property. At last, being aware that they could not hold out
against the force that they knew would be summoned to
reduce them, they broke into the Treasury safe, and
collecting all the property they could take with them,
decamped in the night. The people, who throughout had
behaved loyally, promptly went in pursuit, overtook the
fugitives, killed every one of them, although some were
Muka men, and recovered all the cash, arms, and property
that had been carried off.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mention has been made of the Sepoys. It may be
here said how that some of these men came into the Rajah's
service. Many of the Sepoys, who had been mixed up with
the rebellion in India, and were sentenced to death, had
their sentence commuted to penal servitude in the
Andamans for life. The Indian Government proposed
to the late Rajah to take charge of some of these in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>Sarawak, and to this he consented, and fifty arrived from
Port Blair in March, 1866. There were some soldiers, quite
boys, and raw recruits, some of various other trades, and
one or two were of superior rank. On reaching Sarawak,
they all elected to join the military force, and were
distributed among the out-stations. With very few exceptions,
they proved themselves to be a steady and reliable
set of men. They were treated as free men, the only
stipulation imposed upon them was that they were not
to leave the country. A few were pardoned and returned
to India, the rest died as pensioners of the Sarawak
Government.<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c011'><sup>[304]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On May 13, 1870, an attack was made on Sibu
fort<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c011'><sup>[305]</sup></a> by a force of some 3000 Kanowit Dayaks under the
noted chief, Lintong or Mua-ari. Sibu fort, which is
situated on an island, was then in the charge of Mr. H.
Skelton,<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c011'><sup>[306]</sup></a> with Mr. H. Brooke Low as his assistant, and was
manned by a force of about thirteen Sepoys. Mr. Skelton
had been frequently warned of the impending attack, but
gave no credit to these warnings, and would allow no extra
arms to be loaded. That very evening, during dinner-time,
a noted Dayak chief, Unggat, had come in to inform
Mr. Skelton that the place was to be attacked. Mr.
Skelton was angry at being interrupted during his meal,
and vowed, that if no assault was made, the man should be
imprisoned. When the place eventually was attacked, the
chief paced up and down in the fort and would take no
part in the defence.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the custom of the Sepoys to go out by the back-door
before daybreak to perform their ceremonial ablutions,
and of this the Dayaks were aware, and lay in wait about
the exit to surprise them. But the Sepoys were on their
guard, and the door was not opened. The Dayaks then
attacked the fort in force, endeavouring to cut their way
in with axes, but they were beaten off. Amongst the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>killed was Lintong's eldest son, a boy who had been the
inseparable companion of Mr. J. B. Cruickshank, the
Resident of the Rejang, who was then at home on leave.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sepoys behaved well, and had to be restrained
from going out to fight the Dayaks in the open. Had the
fort been taken, the Chinese quarters and the Malay villages
would have fallen an easy prey to the Dayaks, and a general
massacre would have ensued, as the attack was timed to take
place when all the able-bodied Malays were away on their
farms. This is the sole occasion on which an out-station
fort has been attacked in force, and it revealed to the naked
savages the fact that with their primitive weapons it was
futile making such an attempt, except by surprise. But
indeed, on this occasion, a surprise was intended.</p>

<p>FORT BROOKE, SIBU<br /><br />(The Forts at Bintulu, Muka, and Kapit, are similar.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Lintong, the troublesome son of a troublesome father,
had been a constant head-hunter, and, before the establishment
of the station at Sibu, a scourge to the Melanaus
living in the delta of the Rejang. He had before attempted
to surprise Kanowit fort, and it was from his spear that
Mr. Steele had had a narrow escape. He had, however,
fought on the side of the Government in former days; and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>subsequent to the attack on Sibu, after having been deprived
of his liberty for some time, he again became a supporter
of the Government, and eventually a Pengulu. He died
of snake bite in September, 1887.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah left for England in 1869, and went to reside
at Burrator. In the same year he married Margaret Lili
Alice de Windt, his cousin, daughter of Clayton de Windt,
of Blunsdon Hall, Highworth, Wilts, and Dinnington,
Northumberland, and sister to Mr. Harry de Windt, the
famous explorer, who served in Sarawak as A.D.C. to the
Rajah in 1872-1873.</p>

<p class='c006'>A good deal
has already
been said
about that
blot on
the map
of Borneo,
Bruni, and
of its Rulers, and in this chapter
shall be given the history of
the relations between the
Sultans and the present Rajah since his accession, as well
as of the policy of the Foreign and Colonial Offices in
regard to that "wretched phantom the Bruni Government."<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c011'><sup>[307]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Many chapters might well be devoted to the past and
present history of Daru'l Salam, the Haven of Peace, the
sublime Arabic title by which, with a characteristic disregard
of the fitness of things, the Brunis proudly dignify their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>unhappy city, as they do their Sultan with the title of Kaadil-an,
the Just. But like morning dreams, these go by
contraries. The story they would set forth would be a sad
one, as may well be judged from what has already been
related and from what will be told in this chapter, though
a great deal more might be said. It would be interesting,
too, as another example of British indifference to Eastern
affairs. From the commencement, when nearly seventy years
ago the attention of the empire was so strongly drawn to this
nest of murderers and robbers, this haven of criminals, by
the late Rajah, till the end, when in 1905 the British
Government elected to adopt the bankrupt and depopulated
remnant of the Sultanate, its policy in regard to that State
has been remarkable for neither consistency nor astuteness.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the last twenty years of his reign (1852-1885)
the old Sultan, Abdul Mumin, who has been described as
having the soul of a huckster, and who died at the age of
over a hundred, devoted his life solely to the pursuit of
wealth, and the unscrupulous means he employed to enrich
himself produced great oppression and misery. Affairs of
State were a secondary matter with him, and the ministers
and pangirans went their ways unrestrained. Some of these
pangirans, who are related to royalty, a few closely, others
more or less remotely, exercise "Tulin" or hereditary feudal
rights over districts, the ministers holding, ex-officio, similar
rights over other districts; the unhappy people therein
were completely in their power, and could be squeezed at
their own sweet will. Others, not possessing such rights
but armed with authority from the Sultan, easily obtained
at a price, enriched themselves by forced trading.</p>

<p class='c000'>The poorer classes of the Bruni Malays are hard-working
and law-abiding; but when no man's property is safe from
the rapacious grasp of the chiefs, thrift and hard work cease
to have an object, and the country becomes dead to industry
and enterprise. The inhabitants of the interior, and the
Kadayans, an industrious, agricultural people, suffered under
the same disadvantages. Like the Chinese, these people
once cultivated pepper, but for the same cause gave up doing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>so, which is not surprising when even their harvests of rice
were not spared to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The late Mr. C. A. C. de Crespigny,<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c011'><sup>[308]</sup></a> who had a
considerable experience of Bruni and the country around it,
writing upon the condition of the place in the seventies, says:</p>

<p class='c000'>"A Pangiran of high rank, but of small means, went
from Bruni to Kalias, and with his own hands murdered a
Chinaman, his retainers keeping their hands in by the
slaughter of one or more of the man's relations and
dependants. The murderer then gutted the shop and
returned to Bruni. It was stated that the Pangiran belonged
to a Chinese secret society, as young Bruni in general is
said to do, and that the head of the society, having a trade
grudge against the poor fellow at Kalias actually paid the
Pangiran $800 for the deed. Whether this was true or not
would be an interesting subject for investigation; but that
the man was murdered by the Pangiran's own hand, and
his goods and chattels carried away to Bruni, is
undoubtedly the case; and further that the Pangiran was
not punished except by verbal reproof. Herein is anarchy.</p>

<p class='c000'>"On another occasion at Kalias mouth, twenty-eight
Chinese were killed by a band of marauders from up the
river and neighbouring streams. A fine was imposed upon
the river, but no murderers were caught. Herein was want
of power.</p>

<p class='c000'>"On another and later occasion, a Chinaman, also
living at Kalias, was murdered by a band of ruffians from
Padas Damit and other streams, together with his wife,
child, and only servant. On this occasion two of the
murderers were caught, taken to Bruni, and as they were
men of no consequence, summarily executed. Herein is
inconsistency.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Men are enslaved without proper cause, and slaves are
torn from their families and pass to other owners and other
countries, against their wish."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Bruni of the old days, the Bruni of yesterday, and
the Bruni of to-day, are all one.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>Although by treaty and by decree the trade of the
coast of Bruni territory was thrown open to all, the Bruni
pangirans used their utmost endeavours to retain it, and
traders from Sarawak and Labuan were incessantly obstructed
and interfered with. Competition, coupled with free trade,
was not to the taste of these pangirans, and as the old Sultan
was himself too much mixed up in trading transactions to
exert himself to see that foreign traders received due protection,
the pangirans were left a free hand to deal with
them, and their high-handed proceedings were winked at by
Sultan Mumin, if not actually encouraged. A Sarawak
Nakoda, who had been trading with Bruni for some time,
was suddenly attacked when leaving, and fired into by seven
boats which had been lying in wait for him. He managed
to escape himself, but lost his property to the value of $700.
His boat was destroyed, and the Sarawak flag torn to
pieces. Orders were sent down the coast closing some of
the ports to Sarawak traders, and imposing prohibitive
duties in others. One order recommended the people to go
out of the country and "live under the white man in
Sarawak till they rotted" if they would not pay the exorbitant
taxes demanded of them. Sarawak people, collecting
produce in the jungle, or even when fishing along the
coast, had their goods and boats seized.</p>

<p class='c000'>In reply to the Rajah's despatches complaining of these
outrages, the Sultan expressed friendship for Sarawak and a
desire to foster trade, and in one or two cases actually made
reparation; but he excused himself in general by his helplessness
to enforce his will on the turbulent and headstrong
nobles. And, in fact, the difficulties did not lie in lack of
a clear understanding and of formal agreements, perhaps
not in a languid desire on the part of the Sultan to stand
on good terms with the Rajah, but in the arbitrary conduct
of the leading pangirans holding authority along the coast.
Respect for treaties and for fair dealing formed no part of
the mental equipment of these feudal tyrants, and the
central power at Bruni was either too weak, or too timid, or
too deeply involved to interfere with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>In January, 1870, the Rajah wrote to Lord Clarendon:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>"In regard to matters relating to the interests and
welfare of the coast of Borneo to the northward and eastward
of the territory under my control, I am led to understand
that her Majesty's Government has no desire to direct
attention to this part, with a view to bringing about a
better system to further the ends of peace and trade, and
to relieve the honester and lower classes from the gross and
degraded position to which they are now reduced by the
oppressive measures of the Bruni Government. H.H. the
Sultan permits anarchy and bloodshed throughout his
dominions, and there is no exaggeration in saying that this
is carried on within sight of the British flag at Labuan."</p>

<p class='c000'>The authorities at Labuan, which was a fully constituted
Crown Colony, the Governor being also Consul-General for
Borneo, were either purposely blind to what was going on
at Bruni, which was but a few miles off, or were too much
hampered in their actions by instructions from home to
effect any reforms in the State. But, to quote from the
letter of a Naval Officer of high rank, "Mr. J. Pope Hennessy"
(afterwards Sir John Pope Hennessy, who was Governor of
Labuan from 1867-1871), "had an object in upholding the
Sultan and encouraging him in the oppression of his subjects,
as that caused many to take refuge in Labuan." A little
judicious advice, backed by the immense power which the
Sultan and his nobles knew the Governor had behind him,
would have effected much towards the amelioration of the
lot of the natives, but nothing whatever was done. The
Bruni Malays must "stew in their own juice," it was no
concern of her Majesty's Government that Sarawak trade
should be interfered with, for what was Sarawak to Britain?
It was no concern of her Majesty's Government that the
Sultan and his pangirans were breaking the heart of the
people, killing the incentive to industry. It looked on with
a cold eye, and with a callous heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a colony Labuan was a failure. Only a few natives
and Chinese had settled there, and there was little trade.
Instead of being the medium through which reforms on the
coast might be effected, Labuan for long stood in the way,
by checking the spread of the influence of Sarawak along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>the coast. The Foreign Office was guided by the advice of
their Consul-General, and was rarely other than ill-advised,
though the late Sir Henry Keppel "had pleaded the
cause of civilisation that the Rajah of Sarawak should be
encouraged and not thwarted in his attempt to advance."
And he expressed "a hope that he might live to see the
Sarawak territory extended to Bruni itself." Mr. J. Pope
Hennessy in his address to the Legislative Council of
Labuan in June, 1871, said: "The policy promulgated
thirty years ago by some enterprising and benevolent
Englishmen that the Dayaks could be civilised, and that
Europeans could conduct the details of trade and administration
in the rivers of Borneo has proved to be visionary."</p>

<p class='c000'>It is easy to imagine what would be the nature of
advice tendered to the Foreign Office upon Bornean affairs
by such a man. At the time when he made this statement
Sarawak was in absolute tranquillity, and the trade of 1870
had nearly doubled that of the preceding year.</p>

<p class='c000'>And, with exceptions, the Governors of Labuan were
always more or less hostile to Sarawak, because jealous of it.
Labuan was stagnant and Sarawak steadily advancing in
vigorous life.</p>

<p class='c000'>In April, 1872, the Rajah, accompanied by a staff of
English and Malay officers, visited Bruni in the Government
steamers <em>Heartsease</em> and <em>Royalist</em>. It was perhaps not
unnatural that this visit was at first regarded with suspicion
as being in the form of a demonstration against Bruni, to
back unheeded protests against the maltreatment of Sarawak
subjects, and the nonfulfilment of treaty engagements. But
this impression was soon dispelled, and the Rajah was
received by the Sultan, "a fat, kindly-faced old man of
some eighty years of age," with cordiality and honour. The
Rajah's main object in visiting Bruni was to obtain an
effective guarantee that his subjects trading in Bruni
territory should not be molested and unwarrantably interfered
with. A treaty conceding all that the Rajah asked
for was accordingly drawn up and ratified by the Sultan,
and was satisfactory enough on paper. The Sultan
solemnly undertook the redressing of injuries, guaranteed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>protection to traders, and the imposition of fair and
moderate customs duties only.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this treaty, owing to the Sultan being powerless to
enforce its provisions outside the capital, soon became worse
than useless; for, relying on it being observed, Sarawak
traders again ventured into the Bruni ports, only to meet
with the same treatment as before. The extortion of outrageous
customs dues went on as formerly. The Bruni
nobles, "the most useless race that ever encumbered the
earth,"<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c011'><sup>[309]</sup></a> set themselves deliberately to frustrate every object
aimed at in the treaty, and, so that they might keep the
trade with its enormous profits to themselves, they plundered,
and even killed those who ventured to compete with them.
But their day was not to last for ever. The Kayans,
driven to exasperation by the heavy fines and other
extortions imposed upon them, eventually rose against
these tyrants, and drove them out.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>THE SULTAN'S PALACE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Next to the Rejang, the Baram is the largest river
that flows into the sea on that coast. In its basin are
congregated large populations of Kayans and Kenyahs.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1872, the Rajah, accompanied by the Ranee, visited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>this river to ascertain for himself how far it would be safe
for Sarawak subjects to trade there. He steamed a long
way up the river, and was everywhere well received by the
natives, who had been much depressed by extortion and
were eager to be relieved from the thraldom in which they
were held by Bruni. There had been no encouragement
given to them to work the jungle produce in which their
country was rich, except to purchase necessaries, and these
could be obtained through their Bruni masters alone, and
that at exorbitant prices. There was in consequence little
trade at the time. But what this river is capable of producing
may be shown by its trade returns at present. The
exports, entirely of jungle produce, after the district had
been for twenty years under Sarawak, amounted in 1906 to
$272,223.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the Sultan had no real authority over the
Kayans and Kenyahs there still existed among them a
certain regard for him, and of this the Bruni Government
took advantage. These races had never been subdued by
the Sultans by force of arms. They never had voluntarily
tendered submission. The restraint exercised over them was
due mainly to the fact that the Brunis held the mouths of the
rivers and consequently controlled the trade, and that trade
was one in the very necessaries of existence. It was inevitable
that the rulers of Bruni should resent, and resist to the
utmost, the opening of the rivers to Sarawak traders, which
would involve, as they well saw, the drying up of the source
of their wealth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The natives on the Baram had an exaggerated opinion
of the power of Bruni, but this illusion was dispelled after a
feeble attack made on the Kayans in September, 1870,
which resulted in ignominious failure. Still, they were
prepared to submit to such demands which, though
extortionate, custom had taught them to regard as the
Sultan's due, and they could not do without the imports,
which they were precluded from obtaining elsewhere and
from others, than Bruni and the hands of pangirans. But
the rapacity of the pangirans became at last intolerable;
and we will here give two instances illustrative of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>methods adopted by them, which were connived at by the
Sultan.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1873, a mixed party of Dayaks, Tanjongs, and
Bukitans from the Rejang river, working produce in the
Baram, were attacked by the Kayans. Six were killed and
one escaped. The survivor stated that the party had been
treacherously attacked; but on the other hand the Kayans
asserted that the behaviour of the strangers had been so
suspicious that they had satisfied themselves that they
were a head-hunting party. The Rajah complained and
demanded redress. The Sultan sent an agent in his small
steamer to impose a fine, which in itself was excessive.
The agent proceeded to the house of the chief of the lower
Baram Kayans, although these people had nothing to do
with the killing of the subjects of the Rajah, but it was as
far up as he dared to venture, and levied the fine upon
them, demanding double the amount he had been instructed
to impose, the difference, of course, to go into his own
pocket. The Rajah had fixed the fine, but the Sultan had
put on his price as well, so that he might have his pickings
out of the affair, and now his agent doubled that sum. It
was in vain for the chief to protest that neither he nor his
people had been concerned in the murders. The Sultan's
agent threatened the chief that if he did not pay, the
Rajah would send several men-of-war, that others would be
despatched from Labuan, and more from Bruni, and that
all their country would be laid waste and their villages
burned. After a stormy interview, the chief succeeded in
beating the agent down to a fine amounting to $8000, just
thirty times more than the amount demanded by the Rajah
as compensation to the relatives of those killed. And this
fine the chief was constrained to pay.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the death of the Sultana, a commissioner was
sent to Baram by the Sultan to demand the customary aid
towards the obsequies. A meeting of all the chiefs was
summoned by the commissioner, a haji, and, as it happened,
the late Mr. H. Brooke Low, who was then travelling in
the Baram, was present. The Sultan's mandate, requiring
so much from each man, was read and left with the chiefs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>the haji not for a moment suspecting that any one present
could read it. Mr. Low, however, was able to do so, and
when it was shown to him he was shocked, though not
surprised, to discover that the haji had read into the
mandate a requirement for amounts more than double that
demanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the rebellion of the Kayans and the expulsion of
the Brunis from Baram ensued in the middle of 1874;
the river was freed of its oppressors, and the victorious
Kayans menaced every settlement along the coast from
the Baram to Bintulu. The villages were deserted and
the Sultan was in despair, unable to reduce the Kayans,
unable even to protect the Malays. Not only could he
draw no revenue thence, but he dare not even ask for
it. This prepared the way for the transfer of the whole
stretch of coast to Sarawak. So far as the Sultan was
concerned he was glad to commute the sovereignty of a
district, from which little before the revolt, and nothing
after, could be squeezed by himself out of the inhabitants, for
a certain sum guaranteed to be paid to himself annually.</p>

<p class='c000'>To escape Bruni oppression, people were constantly
migrating to Sarawak, principally from the Semalajau, Niah,
and Miri rivers, and in 1876 over 2000 came in. These
poor people had to effect their escape by stealth, and consequently
had to abandon all their property. Shortly after
this upwards of 500 families of Kenyahs moved over into
the Bintulu.</p>

<p class='c000'>In accordance with the treaty with Great Britain of 1847
the Sultan was debarred from ceding any territory to any
foreign power without the sanction of her Majesty's Government.
This gave the British Government the right, or
rather the power, to prevent Sarawak acquiring the Baram,
and this it was prepared to do. As usual it proved obstructive,
and refused to sanction the transfer; it went so far as
to express its unwillingness to allow any territorial change
to be made on the coast of Bruni. This was insisted on
again in 1876, though the Rajah wrote to the Secretary for
Foreign Affairs (March 20) "I may candidly state that a
most pernicious system of robbery and oppression is pursued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>by the hirelings of the Bruni Government. It surely can
scarcely be conceived by her Majesty's Government that
upholding the authority of the Bruni Government is
tantamount to supporting the cause of oppression and
misrule."</p>

<p class='c000'>Her Majesty's Government had refused to interfere in
any way with that of Bruni for the amelioration of the
condition of the people, and the maintenance of open ports
and free trade; had stood aloof as not disposed to interfere
in the internal affairs of the Sultanate, and yet now, most
inconsistently, it stepped in to forbid the cession to Sarawak
of a portion of that miserably misgoverned and depopulated
State.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fact seems to have been that the Foreign Office
had been persistently misinformed as to the position and
prospects of Sarawak, and as to the conduct of the Rajah
towards the Sultan. The latter had agreed to the cession
of Baram to Sarawak; he desired it for monetary reasons,
the only reasons that appealed to or swayed him. But
when Sir Edward Hertslet informed Mr. H. T. Ussher,
C.M.G., who was Governor of Labuan from 1875 to 1879,
and who appreciated the motives which guided the
Rajah, that he "in common with others at the Foreign
Office had fancied that the acquisition of the Baram by
Sarawak would lead to the loss of its sago trade with
Labuan," the cat was out of the bag. Incidently we may
remark that Baram exported no sago, and that there could
then have been little or no trade between that river and
Labuan, for during the first six months of Sarawak rule
the exports amounted in value to $9000 only. It was a
dog-in-the-manger policy, what Labuan could not have, that
it was resolved Sarawak should not have, and the interests
of the people were left out of the question. It is possible
enough that this was inspired by jealousy. No man likes
to see his own field sterile and that of his neighbour producing
luxurious crops. Conceive the feelings of a small
mercer in the same street as a Whiteley or Harrod, who
finds his own business dwindling, and is oppressed by the
extension and success of the great firm a few doors off.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>Such may have been the feeling of a Governor of
Labuan.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah visited England in 1874, and on July 16
handed in a memorandum to the Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs, pointing out that the appropriation by
foreign powers of north-west and north-east Borneo and
the Sulu Archipelago<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c011'><sup>[310]</sup></a> should be guarded against, and
recommended to ensure this, and for the benefit of trade
and of the native communities, that Great Britain should
assume the sovereign power over those territories that
remained to the Sultanate of Bruni, that the Sultan and
his heirs should be pensioned, as well as the five principal
Bruni Rajahs; and that a town should be built at the mouth
of the Bruni river, which should become the headquarters
of her Majesty's Representative, in place of Labuan. All
that the Rajah asked for Sarawak was that Baram should
be incorporated with that State, owing to the fact that the
inland population of that river and that of the Rejang were
greatly intermixed, and should therefore be under one head
and government.</p>

<p class='c000'>A policy somewhat similar to that above indicated was,
a year after, inaugurated with great success in the Malay
Peninsula, and it would doubtless have met with equal
success in Borneo had it found favour with her Majesty's
Ministers then, though thirty years afterwards they saw
reason to adopt it, but only after Bruni had become a
bankrupt State, stripped of most of its territories, and with
its small remaining revenue pawned. At the time when
the Rajah made his proposal, the whole of what is now the
British North Borneo Company's territory, together with
Lawas, Trusan, Limbang, and Bruni, might have been
acquired, and the Sultan would then have become as
powerless to do harm as one of the native princes of the
Federated Malay States, thus relieving the people of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>intolerable oppression of a government which had reduced
the population to a small remnant of what it had been
formerly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The policy adopted in regard to the native States of
the Malay Peninsula in 1875, referred to above, is generally
known as that of Sir Andrew Clarke, who was Governor of
the Straits Settlements from 1873 to 1875. It was the
policy, however, that the late Rajah, many years before, had
advocated as one which should be introduced into all native
States, and he then wrote: "The experiment of developing
a country through the residence of a few Europeans and by
the assistance of its own native rulers has never been fully
tried, and it appears to me, in some respects more desirable
than the actual possession of a foreign nation; for if
successful, the native prince finds greater advantages, and
if a failure, the European government is not committed.
Above all it insures the independence of the native princes,
and may advance the inhabitants further in the scale of
civilisation by means of this very independence, than can be
done when the government is a foreign one, and their
freedom sacrificed."</p>

<p class='c000'>Compare this with the remark made by Sir Andrew
Clarke in his speech before the Legislative Council of
Singapore on the government of the native States: "We
should continue a policy not of aggression upon our
neighbours, but of exercising our own influence, and by
giving them officers to help them."</p>

<p class='c000'>Had the late Rajah's policy been adopted, Sumatra, or
that part of it which had not been relinquished to the
Dutch in 1824, might now contain many States as
flourishing as those of the Malay Peninsula. On March 3,
1844, the Rajah wrote: "I was glad of the opportunity I
had of seeing the political state of Achin, as it fully
confirmed my views, which I made known to Sir ——,
of the steps necessary to protect and enlarge our commerce.
Achin, like Borneo, is now in such a state of distraction that
no protection can be found for life or property. To protect
our trade we must <em>make a monarch</em>, and uphold him; and
he would be a British servant <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i>. We could always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>raise the better and depress the worse, in other words
support those who will benefit ourselves."</p>

<p class='c000'>A policy that both the Rajahs had advocated should
be adopted towards Bruni.</p>

<p class='c000'>For many years, as we have seen, Sarawak had to
contend with the opposing influence of Governors of Labuan
adverse to her advancement, but in 1875 Mr. Ussher was
appointed Governor, and he was not prepared to take for
granted all the stories of Sarawak aggression and intimidation
which were poured into his ears. He sought for
independent testimony, inquired into matters himself, and
was not disposed to gloss over the misdeeds of the Sultan
and his pangirans, and to suppress all mention of these in
his despatches home.</p>

<p class='c000'>Towards the end of his term of office Mr. Ussher wrote
to the Rajah, "I have had an important interview to-day
with Mr. Meade at the Colonial Office. The object in view
was to ascertain the advisability of permitting you to
acquire Baram. I ascertained that the objections against
this step were reduced, firstly, to an idea that undue pressure
was put upon the Sultan; secondly, that resident (!) traders,
British, in that river would be damaged thereby.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I also ascertained that the Colonial Secretary here was
not at all disposed to carry out the views obstructive of
Sarawak advance, which have animated his predecessors;
but that, on the contrary, he was disposed to allow you and
the Sultan to arrive at your own terms, so long as the
Sultan was a perfectly free agent in the matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>"In the course of a rather lengthy, and, I trust, not
ineffective address on my part, I successfully combated
these trivial and groundless objections, and exposed the
fallacy of Sir Henry Bulwer's<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c011'><sup>[311]</sup></a> and Mr. Pope Hennessy's
views with regard to your dealings with the Sultan. I
pointed out also the gross injustice and oppression of the
Bruni rule in these territories, and expressed my firm conviction
of the general desire on the part of the industrious
and agricultural classes to pass under your settled and
civilised rule. I demonstrated that there were <em>no</em> resident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>British traders, either in Baram or elsewhere in these parts,
whose interests could be imperilled. Further, that so long
as you impose no restrictive export duties on native produce
from the river, there was nothing whatever to prevent the
sago, etc., coming to Labuan or anywhere else.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I admitted that I had at first been disposed to adopt
the Sultan's view with regard to your relations with him
generally, but that careful inquiry and matured experience
had proved to me, not only the untruth of the accusations
of intimidation brought against you, but also the advisability
of permitting you to extend your rule by all legitimate
means, instead of supporting from quixotic and mistaken
motives the effete and immoral rule of Bruni. Mr. Meade
finally suggested to me, that the question might be settled
by allowing you to make your own terms with the Sultan,
with the proviso, that any agreement or treaty made
between the two should be subject to the ratification of her
Majesty's Government, who would thus have it in their power
to nullify any injustice either to Bruni or British interests.</p>

<p class='c000'>"From Sir M. Beach's views, and from Mr. Meade's
proposal, I argue that the matter lies now at last in your
own hands, as Lord Salisbury is likely to accept the
Colonial Office views in these comparatively small matters,
on account of its necessarily more detailed and minute
experience of the interests of Borneo generally.</p>

<p class='c000'>"On the whole I think we may congratulate ourselves
on the prospect of a satisfactory solution of this unpleasant
affair. You may always, as you know, depend upon me
never to allow an opportunity to pass of helping you and
Sarawak generally. Apart from our personal friendship, I
act on the conviction that Sarawak is the future regenerator
of Borneo."</p>

<p class='c000'>This was in January, 1879, but Government officials
move slowly, and in a mysterious way, and it was not till
late in 1882 that the Foreign Office sanctioned the annexation
of Baram by Sarawak. Thus, at length, after negotiating
a transfer with the Sultan in 1874, the obstruction of
the British Government was overcome, but it took eight
years to do this.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>A new spirit had come over the Governors of Labuan,
and the somewhat ignoble spite, bred partly of ignorance
and partly of jealousy, which had characterised their conduct
with regard to Sarawak, and the Rajah in particular, was
exchanged at last for generous and honest recognition of the
excellence of his rule, and of the injustice of forcing the
natives against their will to remain under the cruel
oppression of this Old Man of the Sea astride on their
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000'>The subsequent administrators of Labuan were favourable
to Sarawak, but in 1889 the Colony was handed over
to the British North Borneo Company. Their officials had
no authority outside of Labuan and did not correspond
with the Foreign Office, and Consuls were appointed to
Bruni.</p>

<p class='c000'>In June, 1883, the Rajah visited Bruni, and was received
by the aged Sultan with special marks of distinction.
The Sultan waited at the entrance of the audience chamber,
and taking the Rajah by the hand, led him to the throne
where he seated him by his side. Negotiations for the
cession of Baram and the rivers and districts lying between
that river and Bintulu were at once entered upon, and
speedily concluded, and on the 13th, the deed of cession
was finally sealed and delivered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cession of this district gave great satisfaction to the
inhabitants, and most of those who had migrated to Sarawak
returned by degrees. A fort was erected at Claudetown<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c011'><sup>[312]</sup></a>
(Merudi) about sixty miles up the Baram river, and here
Chinese and Malay traders soon settled, and a brisk trade
rapidly sprang up. Minor stations were also established at
Miri and Niah. The turbulent Kayans and Kenyahs
speedily became pacified, and existing feuds were settled.
Now, this district is one of the most peaceful and prosperous
in the State.<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c011'><sup>[313]</sup></a> The entrance to the river is, and has been,
a great hindrance to trade, the bar being very shallow and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>exposed, so that it is unsafe for sailing vessels and screw
steamers. The Government accordingly had a special
steamer of 200 tons built in England to carry the trade.
She is practically flat-bottomed, and is propelled by paddles.
Another, larger, was added as the trade increased. In
January, 1884, the Rajah was notified by Earl Granville
that her Majesty's Government had no objection to the
exercise of jurisdiction over British subjects by the judicial
authorities of the Government of Sarawak in this newly-acquired
territory.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only one chief in Baram gave any trouble; and he was
Aban Jau, chief of the Tinjar Kayans. He persistently
interfered, and thwarted the policy of Government as much as
he could without bringing himself into open conflict with the
authorities. He maintained a position of semi-independence,
and flew his own flag. But in May, 1884, he committed an
intolerable act, and had to be humbled. As the affair is
illustrative of the iniquities allowed at Bruni until quite
recently, the particulars may be given. To appease the
manes of his daughter-in-law, Aban Jau sent to Pangiran
Nipa of Tutong, asking for a slave, so that he might
immolate the unhappy wretch. His messengers went
to Bruni, where two pangirans, Matusin and Tejudin,
handed them a slave, an old and decrepit man, whom they
sent as a present to Aban Jau. The Resident at Claudetown,
hearing of this, had the party intercepted and arrested,
but too late to save the slave. He had been killed and his
head taken, as he was too old to walk, and the messengers
did not care to trouble themselves to carry him. Aban Jau
was severely punished; he submitted, and his power was
broken. He was no better than an aged savage, and there
was some excuse for him, as he was complying with
ancestral customs; but there was none for the Muhammadan
Bruni pangirans for despatching a miserable old slave to
a death by torture.</p>

<p class='c000'>In June, 1884, by the Sultan's orders, a Dusun village
was attacked—the time for the attack being chosen when
nearly all the able-bodied men were absent, and over
twenty women and children were killed. Oppression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>became so rife that many refugees crossed the frontier into
Sarawak territory, abandoning in so doing their property
and plantations. In August of the same year, the people
of Limbang broke out into open rebellion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Limbang river waters a wide district that is fertile
and populous. The people possessed extensive sago plantations,
and were comparatively prosperous. On this account
they were all the more oppressed by the pangirans. There
was no protection for person and property, and women and
girls were carried off to fill the harems of Bruni. This was
the people that suffered such cruel wrongs at the hands of
the Pangiran Makota, and it was in this river that he met
his death in 1860.</p>

<p class='c000'>The trouble began with two of the agents of the
Pangiran Temanggong, the then Regent and heir apparent,
being killed whilst extorting taxes. The pangiran thereupon
went up in his steam-launch with a large following, and
proposed that the chiefs should meet him at a certain place
and discuss matters. The proposal was made in guile, his
real purpose being to seize the opportunity for slaughtering
them. But these people had had many years' experience of
pangirans and their little ways, and met guile with guile.
The proposal was acceded to, but whilst the pangiran was
on his way to the appointed rendezvous he himself fell into
an ambuscade.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fire was opened on his party, and he was forced to beat
a retreat, his launch damaged, seventeen of his men killed,
and more wounded. Bruni was thrown into panic, and
stockades were erected to resist an expected invasion. The
Limbang people followed up their advantage by raiding the
suburbs of the town, and a house was attacked within half a
mile of the Sultan's palace.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sultan, then in his dotage, was helpless, and appealed
to the acting Consul-General, Mr. Treacher (now Sir William
Treacher, K.C.M.G.), to help him out of his difficulties. Mr.
Treacher knew that the Limbangs had been driven to
rebellion by the intolerable exactions to which they had
been subjected, and he declined to interfere, unless the
Sultan and his wazirs should concede a charter releasing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>the Limbangs from all arbitrarily imposed taxes, and limiting
taxation to a small poll tax, and a 5 per cent <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad valorem</span></i> duty
on gutta percha, granting them at the same time immunity
for their property and sago-plantations, and engaging that
no more tax-collectors should be sent from Bruni to the
river, and that a general amnesty should be accorded.</p>

<p class='c000'>This charter, embodying so many radical reforms, was
granted with ill-concealed reluctance, and without the
slightest intent of performance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Armed with this document, Mr. Treacher proceeded to
the Limbang. But already the Sultan had sent word to
the Muruts to fall on the Limbangs and kill and pillage as
they liked.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst Mr. Treacher was negotiating with the chiefs,
news arrived that these savages had murdered four Kadayan
women and two men, and they were consequently ill-disposed
to accept the charter. They knew by experience
that they could not rely upon the good faith of the Sultan
and his wazirs. However, Mr. Treacher was urgent, and
hesitatingly they appended their marks to the document;
relying rather on the white man to see that its provisions
were carried out, than feeling that any confidence could be
placed in the word of the Sultan.</p>

<p class='c000'>And in fact, no sooner was the agreement signed, than
the Sultan sent his emissaries into the Baram district to invite
the Kayans to raid the Limbang, but the Sarawak Government
got wind of this, and at once took prompt and effective
measures to prevent the tribes on the Baram from answering
the appeal.</p>

<p class='c000'>In December, 1884, Mr. Frank R. O. Maxwell,<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c011'><sup>[314]</sup></a> who
was administering the Government in the absence of the
Rajah, when at Bruni heard that sixteen Sarawak Dayaks
and four Malays had been killed while collecting produce
in the neighbouring river, Trusan. The Sultan in his
impotence to act, suggested to Mr. Maxwell his willingness
to cede the Trusan district to Sarawak. The feudal rights
over this district were held by the Pangiran Temanggong,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>and he too consented. Bruni and Sarawak, he said, were
the same country, and in transferring his rights to Sarawak
he would be incorporating himself in the Sarawak Government.
Subject to the approval of the Rajah, Mr. Maxwell
accepted this offer of the Trusan.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/p345.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>TRUSAN FORT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Sultan, the Pangiran Temanggong, and other
wazirs and pangirans were then all in favour of the cession
of the Limbang, as well as the Trusan, to Sarawak. The
Chinese and Malay traders and the lower classes strongly
advocated the transfer; and the Regent and the wazir next
to him in rank gave Mr. Maxwell a written promise with
their seals attached that, pending the return of the Rajah,
Limbang should not be transferred to any foreign government.
On the return of the Rajah early in 1885, Trusan
was occupied, and a fort and station established some thirty
miles from the mouth, to which English and native officers
were appointed. The Muruts up the river were a quarrelsome
people, and blood-feuds were common, and gave some
trouble at first. The people generally had become miserably
poor through a long course of oppression.</p>

<p class='c000'>Trusan is a good example of what tact and discretion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>can do in dealing with natives, and the Muruts were the
most savage of those in that part. In a very few years
they became peaceful, well-to-do, and contented, enjoying
the fruits of their labours in security. Trusan has now a
fairly flourishing trade, and the rich plains through which
the river winds, and which in days gone by had been
extensively cultivated with rice, but which had been
rendered desolate by extortion, now afford large grazing
grounds for herds of water-buffaloes, which are bred for
export, and also excellent land for the cultivation of the sago
palm.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barely a month had elapsed since the peace had been
patched up with the Limbang people by the acting Consul-General,
before the people were again in revolt, and many
Bruni Malays, men and women, were killed, large numbers
of buffaloes were mutilated, and again the capital, Bruni,
was menaced. Nothing further was done by the British
Government, and nothing could be done, except to establish
a firm government in the disaffected region, and the Foreign
Office was not prepared to do this. As for the authorities in
Bruni, they were incapable of doing anything. Their only
idea of keeping rebellious subjects under control was to
invoke the aid of wild interior tribes, and invite them to
butcher and plunder all who resisted their exactions, and this
they could no longer do.</p>

<p class='c000'>On May 30, 1885, the old Sultan Mumin departed
this life, at the venerable age of over one hundred years,
and the Pangiran Temanggong Hasim, reputed son of the
late Sultan Omar Ali,<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c011'><sup>[315]</sup></a> the predecessor of Sultan Mumin, was
elevated to the throne. Sultan Hasim, who was past middle
age when he succeeded, was a shrewd man, though hard and
vindictive. His antecedents had not been exemplary, but
hopes were entertained that, being a man of strength of
mind and of advanced ideas, an improvement would be
effected in the administration of Bruni, which would lead
to the establishment of good order and bring the place and
State out of absolute decay into comparative prosperity, but
these hopes, strong man as he was, he was powerless to fulfil.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>In order to appreciate much that occurred during the
reign of Sultan Hasim it is necessary to understand the
conditions under which he became Sultan, and the effect
that these conditions had upon his power and position.</p>

<p class='c000'>His predecessor, Mumin, had an only son, the Pangiran
Muda Muhammad Tejudin, a semi-imbecile, nicknamed
Binjai, literally the son of misfortune, signifying an idiot.
Much as Sultan Mumin would have liked to have proclaimed
his son heir to the throne, it was quite impossible for him to
do so in opposition to the natural objections of the nobles,
upheld, as these were, by the laws of Bruni, which preclude
the accession of any prince afflicted with mental or bodily
infirmity. The succession would therefore fall upon either
of the Sultan's nephews, the Pangiran Bandahara, or the
Pangiran di Gadong, and both claimed it. These two
powerful princes and wazirs, with their feudal and official
territorial rights, and the many nobles and chiefs who owed
them allegiance, represented the most powerful factions in
the country, and the accession of either to the throne would
have plunged the country into bloodshed. To avert this, the
British Government persuaded Sultan Mumin, but not without
bringing considerable pressure to bear upon him, to nominate
the Pangiran Temanggong Hasim, the senior wazir, as his
successor, and to appoint him Regent, the old Sultan being
too feeble-minded to govern.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hasim's elevation to the throne gave profound offence to
the Pangirans Bandahara and di Gadong, and to the majority
of the people, who believed the story of his mean birth, and
that he had no just title to the rank he held as a prince of
blood royal. That his accession was not disputed was due
only to its implied support of the British Government, though
that support would probably have failed him had he been
forced to fall back upon it. The Bandahara and di Gadong,
though they retained their offices, for many years refused him
their support, and would neither attend his Council nor
maintain any kind of relation with him, notwithstanding the
fact that they were his two principal Ministers of State; and
he was powerless to force them to do so, or to deprive them
of their offices.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>Moreover, his predecessor had left him in sore straits for
the means necessary for the support of his government, and
even of his household. None of the late Sultan's property
came to him, and the whole of the crown-lands in Bruni
territory had been illegally granted to others, and these,
though his rightful appurtenances, he had no power to
recover.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sultan Hasim thus came to the throne practically shorn of
everything that goes to the support of a crown. Abandoned
by his ministers, and the loyalty of his people denied him,
deprived of his revenues, and with but a few followers, there
was nothing left him but the sovereign rights, shadowy in
nature since he had not the means fully to exert them. A
pathetic picture; but in spite of his faults it says much for
his personal ability and strength of character that he was
able, not only to maintain his position, but gradually to gain
sufficient power to exert his authority, and to make his will
felt. It must not be overlooked that many of his worst acts
were the direct outcome of his necessitous condition, and the
constant intriguing against him by his own ministers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Owing to lack of power to chastise the rebels, though not
of will, Limbang had been let alone by the Sultan, and for
some time there were no aggressive acts committed by either
side, but in November, 1885, the people of Limbang were
again in open rebellion and had killed two more Bruni
subjects. The Sultan thereupon sent the Rajah two pressing
messages asking him to visit Bruni, and this the Rajah did.
The Sultan laid the state of affairs before him, and declared
that he saw no hope of peace unless the Rajah would consent
to attack the Limbang, and reduce the people to order for
him. Limbang was sufficiently near to be a menace to the
capital. Twice it had been threatened by them, and the
suburbs raided. The third time might be more disastrous.
The town might fall into their hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah, however, declined to interfere. The Limbang
people were at peace with Sarawak, and numbers of his
subjects were working produce in that river, and met with
friendliness there. To reduce these people to submission, and
then to hand them over to oppression, after having deprived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>them of the power to protect themselves, was what the
Rajah would never consent to do. That something must be
done, and done at once, he felt, but the question of what
should be done was for the representative of her Majesty's
Government to decide.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we have before pointed out, in the Sultanate of
Bruni, there are various rights claimed. The Sultan has
his rights, some districts revert to the holders of certain
offices, and others are under the hereditary feudal rule of the
pangirans. Limbang pertained to this last category. The
Sultan was sovereign, but his sovereign rights consisted in
this alone, namely, to send his agents into the country and
squeeze it. The feudal lords were the pangirans, and as
they could not oppress the exasperated and revolted people
any more, they were ready to surrender their rights to the
Rajah, but could not do this without the Sultan's confirmation
and seal. What the Sultan wanted was that the Rajah
should crush the rebellion, so that he might work his vengeance
on the Limbang people, and turn the screw on them till
nothing more could be extracted from them. This the Rajah
perfectly understood, and he declined to do the dirty work
for the Sultan. The refusal of assistance by the Rajah
produced a coolness on the part of the Sultan. He would
not, however, receive this refusal as final, and he repeated his
request to the Rajah in an altered form; he requested him
to place the gunboat <em>Aline</em> with a strong force of Sarawak
Dayaks, also a large sum of money, at his (the Sultan's)
disposal, for the purpose of enabling him to reduce the
Limbang people under his own officers, if the Rajah himself
would not head the expedition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah's refusal aroused an angry feeling in the
breast of Hasim, and this was fanned to bitter hostility, when
the Consul-General informed him and the Limbang people
simultaneously, in reply to a petition of the latter that they
might be placed under the rule of white men, that her
Majesty's Government was prepared to consent to the transfer
of Limbang to Sarawak. The Sultan's hostile attitude was
not shared by his ministers, or by the Bruni people generally,
or even by the hereditary owners or rulers of the Limbang.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>These latter, as has been shown, unable to extract more taxes
from the people, hoped to receive from the Sarawak Government
an annual stipulated income in lieu of precarious and
uncertain exactions. They accordingly begged the Rajah to
take over the river. But the Sultan refused to consent, and
his refusal was probably actuated even then by motives other
than those of revenge and resentment as the sequel will show.</p>

<p class='c000'>In September, 1886, two cold-blooded murders were committed
in the Tutong, within a day's journey overland from
Bruni. Two young pangirans, a man and a woman, had been
living together without the sanction of their respective parents.
The girl, after a while, was ordered by her father, Pangiran
Nipa, to return to him. She did so, and he then put her to
death with his own hands. The young man, Pangiran Japar,
was brother to Pangiran Mat, who had been placed in
charge of Tutong by the Pangiran di Gadong, the ex-officio
holder of feudal rights in that district. Japar and Mat were
both subjects of Sarawak. A short time after the murder of
the girl, Nipa's brother, the Pangiran Tejudin, son-in-law of
the Sultan, and uncle of the unfortunate girl, sent an armed
party to Pangiran Mat, to inform him that a mandate had
been issued by the Sultan for the execution of Japar.
Pangiran Mat did not ask to be shown this mandate, and in
fact Tejudin had none, but was intimidated into allowing his
brother to be killed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah was at the time at Bruni, and he at once
demanded of the Sultan that a fair trial of Pangiran Tejudin
should be held. There was very little doubt that the Sultan's
name had been misused, and Japar was a Sarawak subject.
As no justice was likely to be obtained in Bruni, the Rajah
further demanded that the murderer should be handcuffed and
sent to Labuan for trial, when the truth would come out.
But this was refused. The Sultan naturally was determined
to screen his son-in-law, who had instigated the murder, and
who was then in the palace enjoying his protection. The
Rajah indignantly declined to meet the Sultan so long as
the murderer was sheltered under his roof. So the matter
ended, but it widened the rift between the Rajah and the
Sultan.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>In June, 1887, Sir Frederick Weld, Governor of Singapore,
went to Bruni to settle a dispute between the North Borneo
Company and the Sultan over a debateable strip of land.
Sultan Hasim seized the occasion to pour into the ear of Sir
Frederick a tissue of accusations against Sarawak, and no
Sarawak official was allowed to be present to refute them.
The Government of the Rajah was charged with disturbing
the peace, and with sending its emissaries into the Limbang
to foster discontent, and to keep the rebellion simmering,
in the hopes of being able to find an excuse for annexing the
district. Sir Frederick listened, but apparently believed
little he heard, for he recommended the Sultan to hand
over the Limbang to the Rajah. He further strongly urged
the Sultan to accept a British Protectorate over his remaining
dominions, and to receive a Resident, who might act as
adviser in the administration of the State. The Sultan
consented to this latter recommendation; his intention,
however, to accept a British Resident at Bruni, to prevent his
misrule, and to curb the tyranny of his adherents, was only
pretence. Sir Frederick Weld was perhaps acting beyond
his instructions in proposing the appointment of a Resident,
but the proposal was sound. In September, 1888, the late
Sir Hugh Low, then Resident of Perak, was despatched to
Bruni to conclude an agreement with the Sultan by which
Bruni became a Protectorate.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Federated Malay States, as in the Indian Protectorates,
British Residents are placed who can advise as
to the conduct of government, and it is perfectly understood
by the native rulers that their advice must be followed. Now,
a British Protectorate had been extended over Bruni, and
as a consequence a Resident should have been placed there
to control the Sultan and check the misdoings of his chiefs.
But nothing of the sort was done. The Limbang was left
in a condition of disorder, and a menace to its neighbours,
and the Brunis to the arbitrary injustice and cruelty of
their rulers. Trusan now offered a near haven of refuge
to which many fled, both slaves and free-born people, the
latter chiefly to save their daughters from a fate worse
than slavery—a short period in a harem, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>domestic drudgery for life. The British Government would
do nothing, and looked very much as if it were not
disposed to allow any one else to do anything. Sir Hugh
Low,<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c011'><sup>[316]</sup></a> who had an exceptional experience of Bruni and the
people, had urged the Sultan to place the Limbang under
the Rajah, tendering the same advice as had Sir Frederick
Weld; but to this, also, Hasim turned a deaf ear.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Limbang chiefs, after having maintained their
independence for six years, early in 1890 decided to settle
the question of their future for themselves. They assembled,
and of their own free will and accord placed their country
under the protection of Sarawak, and themselves under the
authority of its Government; in token of which they hoisted
the Sarawak flag. In justice to the claims of the inhabitants,
and in conformity with a promise he had made to them to
tender such assistance as lay in his power, the Rajah
accepted the responsibility thus placed upon him, and
annexed the country on March 17, subject to the approval
of her Majesty's Government.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah had already frequently approached the
Sultan on behalf of these unfortunate people to urge
that justice should be done to them, and that they should
not be given over to be preyed upon by rapacious
pangirans. The Pangiran Muda, son of the late Rajah
Muda Hasim, who by birth was the nearest to the throne,
and who possessed feudal rights over a part of the Limbang,
having abandoned all hope of being able to exercise those
rights and draw any revenue from the district, ascended the
river and openly proclaimed to his people that he had
handed over all his rights to the Rajah. The other
hereditary holders of feudal authority in the district had
again approached the Rajah, and had entreated him to
annex Limbang, which had become not only unprofitable to
them, but a menace to Bruni. The Rajah would have
been untrue to his word passed to the Limbang chiefs had
he left them to their fate, after the failure of his negotiations
and repeated attempts to intercede for them with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>Sultan. Although he was averse to taking this step, yet he
felt that it was not possible for him to refuse the appeals
that came to him from all sides to interfere, and it was the
only solution of the difficulty, failing the appointment of a
British Resident, for the people could not be expected to
again place themselves under the power of a Sultan who
would keep no promises, and who intended no mercy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sultan, however, mortified in his pride, and being
thus prevented from giving vent to his vindictive feeling,
had remained obdurate. For some time he had been
accumulating arms and ammunition at Bruni for a great
attempt upon the Limbang, whilst through his minister, the
di Gadong, he was keeping up a pretence of peace. If
he succeeded, the horrors that would have ensued in the
Limbang may well be conceived; but if he failed, he would
draw on Bruni hordes of desperate savages, infuriated by
years of ill-treatment, and the Brunis feared that the capture
of their town and a general massacre would be the result.</p>

<p class='c000'>These were the reasons that led the Rajah to act
promptly, and to appeal to her Majesty's Government to
sanction such action. The Foreign Office approved, after
having kept the Rajah in anxious suspense for a year,
and fixed the annual sum to be paid by the Sarawak
Government for the Limbang at $6000, but failing the
Sultan's acceptance of this for three consecutive years, this
indemnity would be forfeited.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sultan declined to receive this compensation, not,
however, so much as a protest against the action of the Rajah,—a
purpose with which he has generally been accredited, with
not a little misplaced sympathy,—but mainly to punish his
recalcitrant ministers, the Pangirans Bandahara and di
Gadong. Hitherto he had been quite powerless to do this,
but an opportunity was now afforded him, and he did not
hesitate to avail himself of it. The two pangirans were the
principal holders of the feudal rights over the Limbang,
which of late years had yielded them nothing, and they
naturally desired, badly off as they were, that the Sultan
should sanction the acceptance of the indemnity, the
greater part of which would have reverted to them, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>would have afforded them a fixed and ensured revenue, even
more than they had ever been able to extort from the
people. The remainder would have gone to the Pangiran
Muda, and not a cent of it would have gone to the Sultan.
But by the laws of Bruni, feudal rights cannot be alienated
without the sanction of the Sultan; and he subsequently
informed the British Consul that he had withheld his
sanction, and would do so as long as he lived, a determination
to which he vindictively adhered, solely that he might
deprive his two ministers of the revenues to which they
were entitled. He went so far as to tell the Consul that
he had no real grievance against the Rajah, but it being
necessary to find some plausible pretext for his decision he
had invented one, which no one in Bruni could call into
question.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Spenser St. John, writing privately to the Rajah at this
time said, "If the Foreign Office could understand how the
Bruni Rajahs govern Limbang, they would make no objection
to your taking it over. It is a most interesting river, and
when no longer harassed by Kayan raids<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c011'><sup>[317]</sup></a> and plundered
by Bruni Rajahs, it will be one of the richest on the coast.
Sago can be planted to any extent, and it used to be famous
for its pepper gardens. In fact Chinese were working there
nearly to the foot of Mulu mountain"—over one hundred
miles from the coast.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in his life of <cite>Rajah Brooke</cite> published in 1899,
Sir Spenser St. John alters his tone. He remarks that
"unless we are to adopt the principle that 'the end justifies
the means,' it is difficult to approve the action of Sarawak
in seizing by force any part of the Sultan's dominions. A
little gentle, persevering diplomacy would have secured
Limbang without violating any principle of international
law. I am convinced, however, that the present Rajah was
deceived by some one as to the political position of that
district, as he wrote that, for four years previous to his action,
Limbang was completely independent of the Sultan, which
his officers subsequently found was not the case."</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the first part of this statement, Sir Spenser when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>he wrote it, had severed his connexion with Borneo for
nearly forty years, and it shows how little he was kept in
touch with Bornean affairs since he left; or does Sir Spenser
imagine that he would have succeeded where such men as
the Rajah and Sir Hugh Low had failed; both of whom
had continually urged reforms on the Sultan, to which he
had turned a deaf ear?</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to the second part of the statement, the
Rajah certainly did not place himself in a position in which
he could be deceived. He conducted all negotiations and
all inquiries himself, and on the spot. He was no more
deceived as to the true state of affairs than were Sir William
Treacher, Dr. Leys (Consul-General), Sir F. Weld, and Sir
Hugh Low. It is, moreover, not correct that the Rajah's
officers subsequently made the great discovery that is attributed
to them. Sir Spenser might well have been a little
more explicit as to this last remark. He agrees, however,
that there can be no doubt that the inhabitants of Limbang
rejoiced to be placed under the Sarawak flag.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I knew them well, and how they suffered from the
exactions of the Pangirans, and their rapacious followers,
and no one would have more rejoiced than myself to hear
that they had been put under Sarawak rule in a less forcible
way. As poverty increased in Bruni, so had the exactions
augmented, and Limbang, being near, suffered the most.
Perhaps some of my readers may think that in this case
the 'end <em>did</em> justify the means.' At all events, that
appears to have been the view taken by the Foreign
Office."</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Spenser might very well have accepted the view
taken by the Foreign Office, under which he has served with
distinction for many years. The Foreign Office judged upon
facts that were placed before it, and these facts Sir Spenser
had not under his eye when basing this unfair criticism
upon the Rajah's proceedings.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Limbang having been annexed in 1890, a Government
station was established some fifteen miles from the
river's mouth, and settlers, both Malay and Chinese, soon
arrived, and took up their quarters there; indeed, a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>many quitted Bruni, and applied for sites upon which to
build shops and houses directly the flag was raised.</p>

<p class='c000'>The station is now a flourishing little place, and has
been well laid out by Mr. O. F. Ricketts,<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c011'><sup>[318]</sup></a> who has been
Resident there since its establishment. It is the prettiest
out-station in Sarawak; has miles of good riding roads, a
bazaar that is well attended; and, being another refuge for
the oppressed, the Malay population is continually increasing.
Mr. Ricketts, who also has over-charge of the Trusan and
Lawas districts, has been eminently successful in his management
of the Muruts and Bisayas, of whom he has had some
twenty years' experience, and is popular with all classes at
Bruni.</p>

<p class='c000'>In reporting on Limbang in February, 1891, Mr.
Ricketts observes: "since the occupation of the river in
March last, matters have progressed satisfactorily, and the
inhabitants have shown themselves well disposed and satisfied
with the new order of things, with the exception of three or
four of the Danau chiefs, who have been incited to be otherwise
from Bruni.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Little has been done with the exception of visiting
the people, who at all times have been allowed to trade
freely with Bruni; no import or export duties have been
collected. A number of Brunis have come into the river
at different times to wash sago, who previously were unable
to do so, owing to the unsettled state of the place.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Most of the principal Chinese of Bruni have been over
here at different times, and have expressed their wish to
commence business here. One firm already holds one of
the shops, of which there are six, the others being held by
Sarawak and Labuan Chinese; one sago factory is in course
of erection.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There has been no revenue for the year; the expenditure
amounting to $11,812. No revenue was
demanded, until the natives settled down, and had
recovered from their previous unsettled state. The expenditure
was chiefly in public buildings, bungalows, court
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>house, barracks, etc." The imports and exports in 1906
amounted to $282,277, against only $86,687 in 1891.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is no fort at Limbang.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the reader will look at the map he will see that a
peninsula or horn runs out from Bruni, sheltering the bay
against the winds and waves from the north-west. Labuan
is actually a continuation of the same, but the belt of land
has been broken through, leaving only Labuan and a few
little islands rising above the surface of the ocean. At the
extreme point of the promontory is a lighthouse erected by
the Rajah. This promontory goes by the name of Muara.
The coal-beds that come to the surface in Labuan, continue
in Muara, and Mr. W. C. Cowie<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c011'><sup>[319]</sup></a> had obtained from the
Sultan Mumin a concession of the coal-fields in Muara, and
all rights over this district were ceded to him in perpetuity
by the late Sultan in 1887. These rights confer complete
and absolute possession of all the lands in the district, with
power to sell, impose taxes, rents, and assessments, the
possession of the revenue farms, with power to create new
farms of any description, and certain judicial rights conjoined
with power to inflict penalties.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Muara district, the town in which was founded by Mr.
Cowie, and named by him Brooketon in honour of the Rajah,
is the richest portion of the small and shrunken territory
now remaining to the Sultanate of Bruni, and it remains to
it, as may be seen, attached by a thread only. It is not
large, but it is of much importance, as it possesses a good
colliery and an excellent harbour. Previous to the opening
of this colliery the population, consisting of a few Kadayan
peasants and Malay fishermen, was small and scattered, and,
in common with the lower classes throughout the Sultanate,
led a miserable existence under misrule.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Cowie found that a much larger capital was needed
to develop the colliery than he possessed, without which the
workings would be unremunerative. Every year entailed
increasing loss, and in 1888, two years before the acquisition
of the Limbang by the Rajah, he sold to him all his rights in
Muara.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>Previous to the transfer, for want of capital, the mines
had been worked in a hand-to-mouth fashion by a few
coolies under a manager with but little experience, the
output being confined to meeting the very limited local
demand in Labuan. There was practically no plant, and
only a small ricketty wharf, to which the surface coal was
conveyed in buffalo-drawn waggons over a roughly constructed
line.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those who knew Brooketon in those days and know it
now, can testify to the great improvements that have been
made by the Rajah's persistent efforts. The greatest
possible benefits have been conferred upon the people by
the establishment of a large and growing industry among
them, but it has been effected at a heavy financial loss. The
colliery has been placed under experienced managers; expensive,
though necessary, machinery, locomotives, a steam
collier, lighters, etc., have been purchased, extensive and
solid wharves built, and a new line laid down. The cost of
these, with the many other preliminary expenses incidental
to the proper working of a large colliery, have been heavy,
and so far it has proved an unremunerative speculation.
The colliery employs hundreds of miners and workmen,
and through it, indirectly, many people gain a livelihood,
and the thriving settlement of Brooketon is solely dependent
upon it. Law and order have been effectively maintained
by the Rajah at his own cost, though in the name and with
the consent of the Sultan. Although financial improvement
may be remote, closing the mines down would mean a loss
of all these benefits to the people; the place would revert
to its former condition, and the population would be
dispersed. This consideration has induced the Rajah to
continue working the colliery, with the hope of ultimately
lessening the losses, and the remoter hope of ultimate
success. To Brooketon we shall again refer.</p>

<p class='c000'>In March, 1905, a chief named Lawai, who had been
dignified by the Sultan with the title of Orang Kaya
Temanggong, with some 400 of his numerous following,
removed into the Limbang river from the Baram, in defiance
of Government orders. In former days these people had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>been the most forward amongst those employed by the
Bruni Government to molest the Limbang people, and a
short time previous to their removal to the Limbang
had killed three Kadayans in Bruni territory, who had
incurred displeasure in certain high quarters. After these
murders had been committed, Lawai had been favourably
received by the Sultan at Bruni, and this no doubt
encouraged him openly to resist the Government. A small
force was despatched against him, and, taken by surprise,
he was captured.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rendezvous of this expedition was off Muara island,
at the entrance to Bruni bay, and, as its object was kept
a profound secret, considerable uneasiness arose in the
suspicious minds of those at Bruni, who with good reason
feared the displeasure of the Rajah. A secret meeting of
the leading pangirans and chiefs was held; at which it was
decided that should it be the Rajah's intention to sweep
away their evil government they would kill the Sultan and
hand over the city to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>With this exception, from the day that the Sarawak flag
had been hoisted, there have been no disturbances in the
Limbang. But in the neighbouring river, the Trusan, the
perpetual petty feuds amongst the Muruts, which led to
isolated cases of murder, wounding, and cattle-lifting, caused
the Government considerable trouble. In 1900, it became
necessary to administer a severe lesson. Some Muruts
living in the far interior under their chief, Okong, aided by
those of the Lawas, not then under the Sarawak Government,
having killed twenty-one Muruts of the lower Trusan,
an expedition, with which the Rajah Muda went, was sent
to punish them. This was so effectually done, that it
resulted in the people of the interior coming in from all
quarters to renounce their feuds; and since that Trusan
has also been free from such troubles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Commenting upon Bornean affairs, the <cite>Singapore Free
Press</cite> in August, 1900, remarked that: "Bruni, though
independent, is in a state of bankruptcy and decay, and
would not be a desirable acquisition for any one. Its
revenues, such as they are, are all leased and sold, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>those who should benefit from them have long parted with
their interests. The aged Sultan, troubled with debts and
worried by creditors, has given powers to the most
importunate in their claims, which action has alienated the
support of those hereditary chiefs who are entitled to share
with him the government of the country. These chiefs
assume semi-independence, and each goes his own way
unchecked, a method which tends to bring affairs of State
to chaos. It is erroneously supposed that the British
Government is responsible for this condition of the country.
As a matter of fact the British Government has no right,
and certainly no inclination, to interfere in the internal
affairs of an independent kingdom."</p>

<p class='c000'>This is a very accurate description of the situation at
Bruni; but, unless we accept the theory that might makes
right, how can the action of the British Government in
appointing a Resident to take charge of Bruni a few years
later on be justified? No one, however, can quarrel
with the statement that the British Government had no
inclination to interfere. That had been made manifest
enough by many years of indifference to the sufferings of a
people, and of shirking moral responsibilities. It is stretching
a point to say that the British Government had no
right to interfere; it was their duty to do so, and that
duty involved the right. Not content with this neglect of
an obvious duty, the Government stood in the people's
way, by preventing them from turning to others for the
aid they so sorely needed.</p>

<p class='c000'>What these sufferings were, Mr. Keyser, who was
Consul at Bruni, fully sets forth in his report to the Foreign
Office for 1899. He wrote: "Such trade as there was has
completely fallen off, and the monthly steamer from
Singapore has ceased its visits. The debts and difficulties
of the Sultan and his chiefs have so increased with time
that this state of affairs naturally reacts upon the people.
With the exception of catching fish, no one does any work,
and all live in poverty and constant want of food.
Hundreds of families have left, and continue to leave, to
escape the seizure of their women and children by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>impecunious headmen, who wish to relieve their own
necessities by selling them as slaves.<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c011'><sup>[320]</sup></a> Others are driven
from the country by the infliction of fines, and the
exorbitant demands of those Chinese and money-lenders to
whom the collection of taxes and all saleable rights have
been long since transferred for cash. Those traders have
full power to oppress the people, and they do so
remorselessly. In a short space of time, if the present
Government continues, Bruni will be empty of inhabitants."</p>

<p class='c000'>The two small provinces, the river districts of Tutong
and Belait, now remaining to the Sultan, have been in a
constant state of revolt. In June, 1899,<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c011'><sup>[321]</sup></a> the people of
these rivers openly threw off their allegiance and hoisted
the Sarawak flag, an act which caused some excitement in
the East, and a good deal of comment in English papers.
The principal chiefs then waited upon the Rajah, and
begged him to take over their country, a petition that was
repeated shortly afterwards. The British Consul was
informed by them that they absolutely refused to remain
under Bruni rule, and they prayed to be placed under that
of Sarawak. But the Consul could only report; and that
Government, which had "no right and certainly no inclination
to interfere," again proved obstructive, and the people
were forced to continue a hopeless effort to gain their liberty.</p>

<p class='c000'>A desultory war commenced, weak in attack from want
of power,<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c011'><sup>[322]</sup></a> and weak in resistance from lack of ammunition
and supplies. Treachery was resorted to by those sent to
suppress the revolt. As an instance of one cold-blooded
deed, Pangiran Tejudin, the Sultan's son-in-law, of whom
one infamous act has already been recorded, persuaded the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>inhabitants of some of the Tutong villages to submit, under
a guarantee that their lives and property would be spared.
To ratify the terms, the pangiran took twenty-five men
from these villages to the Tutong town, and there they were
bound and confined. Then one man from each village was
selected, placed bound within a fence, and there at intervals
slashed at until all had bled to death. Seven only managed
to escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>In October, 1902, many of the inhabitants of Belait and
Tutong, unable to continue the struggle, having sought a
refuge in the Trusan and Limbang rivers, and the Sultan
being wearied into granting an amnesty on the payment of
a heavy fine, those remaining surrendered; their principal
chiefs, however, the Datus Kalim and De Gadong, with their
people, elected to place themselves under Sarawak rule by
also moving into the Limbang.</p>

<p class='c000'>In January, 1905, the British North Borneo Company,
with the sanction of her Majesty's Government, transferred
their cession of the Lawas river to the Sarawak Government.
The inhabitants of this river are closely allied to those of the
Trusan, and, in a lesser degree, to those of the Limbang. It
is a beautiful and fertile district, but sparsely inhabited.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the yearly cession money paid upon the districts that
have been acquired by Sarawak during the sovereignty of
the present Rajah is taken into consideration, not one of
these districts has yet paid its way, and even Limbang,
upon which no cession money is paid, showed a deficit of
expenditure over revenue in 1906, but the increased trade,
of these districts, which in 1906 amounted to just a million
dollars in value shows them to be in a flourishing state,
and this has added to the general prosperity of the raj.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1905, an agreement was made between his Majesty's
Government and the Sultan, by which the latter accepted a
Resident, by whose counsel the affairs of the State were to be
guided, and on January 1, 1906, this agreement came into
effect, and the Sultan and his wazirs were practically laid aside,
the rule becoming British under the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i> ruler, the Resident.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reason given for this step was not so much that the
iniquitous conditions of affairs at Bruni could no longer be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>tolerated, but that the country was bankrupt, and therefore
something had to be done. There were two alternatives
presented, the absorption of Bruni by Sarawak, or the
introduction of the same system of government that prevails
in the Federated Malay States. The latter was adopted as
being, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, likely to be more
beneficial to the Sultanate, as well as being a healthy example
to the neighbouring protectorates, and it has been expressly
stated by the Foreign Secretary that this was done not merely
with a view to the future interests of Bruni, but to those of
the other British Protectorates in Borneo.<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c011'><sup>[323]</sup></a> The only pretext
that has been advanced for not allowing the natural absorption
of Bruni by Sarawak was the supposed animosity the
Sultan bore towards the Rajah, though, had it still existed,
this might well have been regarded only in the light of a
compliment to the latter.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/p363.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>ON THE LAWAS RIVER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But undue importance has been placed upon the ill-feeling
the Sultan had formerly borne to the Rajah, and the fact that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>a complete reconciliation had taken place long before this time
appears to have been ignored. Apart from this, however,
the likings and dislikings of an isolated, and now defunct, old
tyrant were not quite a sufficient basis upon which to establish
a policy antagonistic to the natural fate of Bruni and the
pronounced wishes of the people. But, many months before
it was proposed to establish a British Residency in Bruni, the
Sultan, completely at the end of his resources, had confided
to the British Consul his unfortunate situation; had expressed
his deep regret for the estrangement between himself and the
Rajah, and his desire for a reconciliation, which he begged
the Consul would bring about, for he had no one else to turn
to for the help he so sorely needed, and which he knew the
Rajah would not refuse him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah, who had never lost his kindly feeling towards
the Bruni rulers, at once visited Bruni, and exchanged visits
with the Sultan, which were marked by extreme cordiality
and confidence on the part of the latter. But by no method
short of a clean sweep of its debased Government and corrupt
officials, of whom the Sultan was the most corrupt, could any
improvement be effected in the sad condition of Bruni, or in
the Sultan's miserable plight, and therefore the Rajah, through
the British Consul, offered terms for the transfer of Bruni to
his Government, and these were far more generous to the
Sultan than those which the Foreign Office, with full knowledge
of this offer, subsequently forced the Sultan to accept.</p>

<p class='c000'>The terms offered by the Rajah were placed before the
Sultan by the British Consul, and were well received by him
and his family, and they were anxious to accept these at once.
They were, however, completely in the power of three of the
members of Council,—the Juwatan<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c011'><sup>[324]</sup></a> Abu Bakar, Orang Kaya
Laksamana, and Orang Kaya di Gadong, who had battened
on the Sultan by lending him large sums of money on
extortionate interest, and who, seeing their way to further
affluence, prevented the Sultan accepting the Rajah's offer
until he should have assigned to them all the benefits it
would convey to him, when he would have been called upon
to accept it for their advantage.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>All who have read these pages will agree there can be
no possible doubt that the Sultan and his ministers had well
deserved to have their powers curtailed, even to the extent
of absolute deprivation of all control in the affairs of their
country, but not a few will naturally wonder why the Foreign
Office had not arrived at such an obvious conclusion many
years ago. Then the reasons for interference were tenfold
more weighty than now. Successive years have seen the
Sultanate stripped of its territories, and the capacity of the
Sultan and his bureaucracy to do evil lessened in proportion
to the loss of population, revenues, and power. Then the
British Government would have become possessed of a large
territory, nearly as large as England, with a numerous population,
and would have had a reasonable prospect before it of
establishing a State or Colony which might at this time be
as flourishing as any of those in the Malay peninsula; now
they have unnecessarily hampered themselves with a miserable
bankrupt remnant of a formerly large State, some 3000
square miles in area only, with a total population of not
more than 15,000; with no internal resources to develop,
and with revenues so slight as to be inconsiderable, an experiment
which appears to be proving costly.</p>

<p class='c000'>To contend that the governmental system of the
Federated Malay States would be a good example to
Sarawak is to presume a superiority in that system, and to
infer that the conditions prevailing in the former and latter
States are on a parity. So far there has been no convincing
evidence of the superiority of this system in its
application to Bruni, though that is not surprising, as the
British Resident can hardly be expected to make bricks
without straw; and Sarawak, which has the credit of having
"the best form of government for a country populated by
an Oriental people of various races," would scarcely be wise
to exchange the simple methods that have been gradually
built up to meet the requirements of her population for an
elaborated system, which, however successful it has been in
the States for which it was formed, might not be altogether
conformable to existing conditions in Sarawak. There is
almost as much difference between the populations of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>Malay States and Sarawak, as there is between that of the
latter and Java or Ceylon, and the same difference exists in
regard to Bruni. To argue that a form of government,
because it is eminently adapted to the circumstance of
one country would necessarily be suitable to another, is to
be optimistic, and shows a want either of common sense, or
of knowledge of the respective conditions of the countries
indicated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps the mysterious profession of the Foreign
Secretary in regard to the future interests of all the British
Protectorates in Borneo, which has been noticed, conceals
the real motives, yet to be revealed, for this sudden departure,
which red tapeism can hardly explain away, and which has
given rise to a political position that is peculiar, whether
viewed in the light of expediency or as a matter of sheer
justice. The professed motives appear to be scarcely
logical, for this fresh policy involved no obvious advantages
to the Empire, was displeasing to the natives, and unfair to
the interests of Sarawak. But, unfortunately, evidence is not
wanting that there are other motives, which are not only
illogical but unwarrantable, and it is only by keeping these
in view that the policy of the British Government becomes
intelligible. It is a policy that has not originated at the
Foreign or the Colonial Office, but has been adopted by
both "on advice given with entire knowledge of place and
people"—how, when, and by whom acquired, it would be
interesting to learn.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whether Bruni was governed from Singapore or
absorbed by Sarawak was a question of little importance
to the public, and should have been one of minor
importance to the Foreign Office, for either way its position
as a British Protectorate would remain unaffected. No one
can assert that it is possible to find a man with greater
qualifications as a ruler of natives or with a greater knowledge
of Bruni and its people than the Rajah of Sarawak, or one
whose counsel would have greater weight with chiefs and
people, to whom the task of reforming and regenerating that
country might with wisdom have been entrusted. Then comes
the question of means, so necessary to the establishment of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>an effective government. To set up such a government in
Bruni, and to maintain it, requires a considerable outlay, and
an ever-recurring yearly subsidy. This the Rajah knew, and
this he was willing and able to bear, but those "with entire
knowledge of place and people" thought differently, with
the result that the overflowing Treasury chest of the
Federated Malay States has had to be drawn upon,<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c011'><sup>[325]</sup></a> and
within two years yet another burden in the shape of a debt
of some £24,000 has been needlessly put upon an already
bankrupt State; and still, with a newly-imposed tariff, which
is scarcely in harmony with that of the Federated Malay
States, or of Sarawak, Bruni is unable to make both ends
meet, and has the pleasant prospect before it of having to
negotiate a further loan with no security to offer. So much
for expediency.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the Sultan was not averse to Bruni being incorporated
with Sarawak has been shown, and the fact must
not be overlooked that he <em>was</em> averse to the appointment
of a British Resident, and the acceptance of the agreement
by himself and his Prime Minister and brother-in-law, the
Pangiran Bandahara, was obtained only under pressure, and
was granted in opposition to the forcibly expressed wishes
of his own immediate relations, of his chiefs, and of his
people. He died shortly afterwards, at a great age, though
he retained his faculties until the end, and was succeeded
by his son, Muhammad-ul-Alam, a minor, who was placed
under the regency of his uncle, the Pangiran Bandahara.</p>

<p class='c000'>That they might pass under the protection of the Rajah
and share with his subjects the liberties and privileges the
latter have gained, has always been and still is the desire
of the people. With the methods of his government they
are familiar and in sympathy. They and their chiefs, from
the Regent downwards, have petitioned to be so placed. To
them the Rajah's name is a household word, and by them
he is trusted. When the change came in 1905, many of
the principal nobles begged him to become the guardian of
their children, to safeguard their inheritance and welfare.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>His great influence, acquired by an intercourse of half a
century, has always been exerted for their benefit, and it is
an influence that, together with his knowledge of the people
and what is best for them, can scarcely be equalled by ever-changing
officials.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between the populations of Sarawak and Bruni there
exists community of origin, and relationship of ideas and
customs. Formerly the two countries were one. Then in
a corner of that country arose the little independent raj
of Sarawak, which gradually expanded up to, around, and
beyond Bruni. Now Bruni is but an enclave within
Sarawak, and socially, politically, and commercially, as well
as geographically, is undoubtedly within the sphere of her
influence.</p>

<p class='c000'>A short description of Brooketon has already been given,
showing how the prosperity of that flourishing little settlement
is dependent upon the working of its colliery, and that
this has been the Rajah's main reason for continuing to
work it, though with a recurring annual loss which in
the aggregate during the past twenty years has exceeded
$800,000; of course exclusive of purchase money and
interest thereon. In no one year have the receipts exceeded
the expenditure, and the chances of financial improvement
appear to be vastly remote; yet, in October, 1906, the
Colonial Office decided, presumably "on advice given with
entire knowledge of place and people," to further hamper
this industry by imposing a duty on the coal exported,
thereby seriously compromising the welfare of the district
by taxing the sole factor in its prosperity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The levying of such a "harsh and oppressive"<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c011'><sup>[326]</sup></a> tax,
was not only unjust, but distinctly contrary to the terms
of the deed under which the Rajah holds his concession.
Whilst protesting against the assumption that the Bruni
Government has the right to impose such a duty, the Rajah
informed the Colonial Office that if it was insisted upon he
would be compelled practically to close down the colliery.
In the House, Sir Edward Sassoon pointedly asked the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>Under-Secretary for the Colonies "on what principle such a
tax would be imposed upon a nascent industry which is
being created at a sacrifice in an impoverished country, while
on the other hand his Majesty's Government has recently
withdrawn the duty levied on all coal exported from
Great Britain." To this question no direct reply was or
could have been given, but it was not until a year afterwards
that the Colonial Office decided that the tax would not at
present be imposed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reason given for the imposition of this tax was that
all other sources of revenue at Brooketon having been
hypothecated to the Rajah, it was therefore necessary to
levy export duties. It has already been stated (p. <a href='#Page_357'>357</a>)
how these revenues had reverted to the Rajah, but it must
not be supposed that they had been obtained for little or no
consideration. To protect his own interests by guarding
against any imposition of harassing taxes, the original lessee
of the Brooketon Collieries had leased the revenues of the
district from the Sultan for an annual sum, and this rent
was subsequently capitalised by the payment of a sum of
money equivalent to ten years' rent; thus these revenues
passed from the Sultan's hands for ever, and subsequently
became vested in the Rajah by purchase. A careful
consideration of the deed by which these revenue rights
were granted, combined with a competent knowledge of the
prerogatives of the Sultan, would leave little doubt in an
unprejudiced mind that the imposition of any import or
export duties at Brooketon by others than the Rajah would
be an infringement of the rights conveyed by that deed.
The revenues derived by the Rajah under this deed (and
he has not exerted his powers to increase them) represent
but a very small return as interest on the purchase money;
yet in face of such kindly moderation, we find the Colonial
Office attempting to impose a tax on the Rajah's property,
which would yield to them more than three times the
amount of the legitimate revenue arising from a benevolent
enterprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>Previously to the appointment of a British Resident at
Bruni, the Rajah had, as we have noticed, administered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>the government in the Muara district, with the full approval
of the Sultan. In compliance with the Rajah's desire, the
Sultan had placed a Malay chief, as his representative, at
Brooketon, but even his salary had to be paid by the
Rajah. It has already been shown that certain judicial
powers have been vested in the Rajah under the revenue
concession, in regard to which the then British Consul at
Bruni had occasion to write to the Rajah's agent at Labuan
in July, 1900, that "the acting High Commissioner for
Borneo believes in and acknowledges the right of Sarawak
to exercise magisterial powers in Brooketon." Nevertheless,
on the appointment of the British Resident at Bruni the
Colonial Office called upon the Rajah to withdraw his
officials and police from Brooketon, and notified him that
the administration of the district would be carried on by
the Resident, in the Sultan's name. In a written reply
to a question by Sir Edward Sassoon, the Under-Secretary
for the Colonies denied that by the deed the Rajah was
authorised to maintain a police force in Bruni (<cite>sic</cite>), but
passed over in silence the main point of Sir Edward's
question as to the Rajah's powers to adjudicate as well as
to impose fines throughout the district of Muara.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a leading article which appeared in the issue of the
<cite>Straits Budget</cite> (Singapore) of January 10, 1907, the
editor attempts to refute the issues raised in the questions
put by Sir Edward Sassoon in the House of Commons, and
the arguments advanced in an editorial article which
appeared in the <cite>Standard</cite> dealing with the above matters.
He writes authoritatively in reply to Sir Edward and "the
special pleading" of the <cite>Standard</cite>, and presumably his
article is therefore an inspired one, for his own knowledge
of Bornean affairs is restricted to what "the man in the
street" can tell him, and his leader displays a deeper insight
into the political aspect than can usually be found outside
of a Government office. He tells us that: "Bruni wanted
better administration. There were three possible ways of
obtaining this—the Protectorate might have been transferred
to the British North Borneo Company; it might have been
handed over to the neighbouring Rajah of Sarawak; or it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>might have been incorporated in the territories administered
by the Colonial Office through the Straits Settlements. Of
the three alternatives the Foreign Office chose the last. No
doubt Sarawak is an object lesson in administration,
but it must not be forgotten that it has been fortunate
in having two successive rulers of marked capacity for
dealing with native races. It may not always be so
fortunate, and perhaps the Foreign Office, having this
possibility in view, hesitated to add to the territory of
Sarawak. On the other hand, the experience of the
Federated Malay States and the Straits Settlements
warranted the handing over of Bruni to the Colonial Office,
and we are sure that when consideration is given to the
larger interests involved it will have to be admitted, one day,
that the Foreign Office took the wiser course. There may
come a day when British interests in Borneo will have to be
amalgamated and concentrated under one administration;
but until then Bruni affairs can be best administered and
the interests of the natives safeguarded under the arrangement
now in force."</p>

<p class='c000'>The editor has ignored the fact that the natives of
Bruni of all races—and the small population is a very
diversified one—desired incorporation in Sarawak, and had
petitioned for it; and he has overlooked the fact that such
incorporation, whilst saving the Straits Settlements both
money and trouble, could in no way have affected the
position of Bruni as a British Protectorate, or have interfered
with any policy which the Foreign Office may possibly
have in view. So far as Sarawak is concerned, "the
possibility in view" can mean only one thing: future
interference with its independence, arising out of anticipated
maladministration by the present Rajah's successor.
Such an inuendo is as uncalled for, as it is unjust,
however the suggestion may be disguised; and it behoves
the Foreign and Colonial Offices to dissociate themselves
from such expressions, which unfortunately have derived
some colour from their subsequent actions.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the system of government in vogue in the
Federated Malay States and the Straits Settlements is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>irreproachable cannot be denied; but at the same time it
cannot fairly be contended—in the face of all evidence to
the contrary—that it is as well adapted to the requirements
of Bruni as is that in vogue in Sarawak, a system
which the editor admits "is an object lesson in administration,"
and which his local contemporary, the <cite>Singapore Free
Press</cite>, has before described as "a government for natives
second to none."</p>

<p class='c000'>What are "the larger interests involved" which appear,
in the editor's opinion, to have necessitated the handing
over of Bruni, against the wishes of the people, to a government
foreign to them? The editor answers the question
with a prophecy, which, unless it emanates from his own
fertile brain, throws light on the policy of the British
Government, and hints at a possible disregard of fair-play
and treaties, which has only been made possible by
the acceptance of British protection by Sarawak. The
British Government as far back as 1863 fully acknowledged
the independence of Sarawak under the rule of its white
Rajah, and the agreement of 1888, by which the State was
placed under British protection, was not intended, nor
accepted, as one which would militate against that independence,
and such a possibility can scarcely be construed
as following in the train of that agreement.</p>

<p>LAND-DAYAK WEAPONS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In an address to the
Council Negri in
1891, the Rajah said
that he might divide
his term of service of
thirty-nine years into
three periods of thirteen
years each. The
first period had been
almost wholly devoted
to the work of suppressing
head-hunting among
the Dayaks, involving
frequent expeditions by
sea and by land, and a
life of carrying arms and
keeping watch and ward
against subtle enemies. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>second period had been divided between expeditions of the
same nature, and the peaceful pursuits of giving or amending
law, and the establishment of its supremacy. And the
last period had been almost entirely taken up with attending
to the political and social affairs of a settled and peaceful
country. Those present who had been young with himself
during the early days of his service, had been strong and
able to carry through the work set before them, rough and
perilous in the extreme, in mountainous regions of jungle,
subject to every kind of exposure; but now these hardships
were no more required, and that was well, for both they and
himself were waxing old. The character of his task was
changed—he and his old comrades on river and rock and
in jungle could sit in their arm-chairs, and attend to the
political business and the commercial progress of the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>To these periods the Rajah has since added a fourth,
and that the longest of all, during which much has been
done to extinguish the lingering sparks of racial and intertribal
hostility. These still break out occasionally amongst
the Sea-Dayaks, though at wider intervals, as time goes on,
but are confined to the remote interior, and to a very limited
district within the State and over the borders, of which
Lobok Antu is the centre. These occasional outbreaks,
which but reveal the old Adam, do not trouble or affect
those living outside this district, and indeed do not stir
their interest any more than the border troubles in India
affect the population of that country generally.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is an Arab proverb—Be content with bread and
scrape till Allah sends the jam. The first Rajah certainly
had very hard scrape, and in the first periods of the second
Rajah's career, he had to be content with bread and scrape,
only slowly, though surely, came the jam.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ulu Ai<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c011'><sup>[327]</sup></a> Dayaks, or, as the name implies, those
inhabiting the head-waters of the Kapuas, Rejang, and
Batang Lupar, are nowadays the sole offenders, and
although they lead others astray, these troubles involve but
a small proportion of the Dayak population, but five per
cent, or one per cent of the entire population of Sarawak.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>A quarter of a century ago, Malays were forced to live
together in villages, for their protection against the Sea-Dayaks,
and were constrained to move in strong and well-armed
parties when visiting these people for the purpose
of trade. Now they occupy scattered houses on their
farms, where they can make gardens and plantations,
and they mix freely with the Dayaks without the least
fear.</p>

<p class='c000'>But even the Ulu Ai Dayaks, in spite of their occasional
lapses, are far from being inimical to the Government, for
which they are ever ready to work, and which they will as
readily follow. At all times, its officers, English and Malay,
are quite safe amongst them, and are received with respect and
cordiality. Punishments, however severe, are submitted to,
and do not affect their feelings towards the Government.
On the whole these Ulu Ai Dayaks are well disposed, but
they allow themselves to be led astray by the more unruly
and restless spirits in the tribes; yet even of these latter,
some have been brought to become staunch supporters of
the Government.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Saribas Dayaks, formerly the most malignant and
dreaded of pirates and head-hunters, and the bitterest
opponents of the Rajah, have long since become the most
peaceful subjects of the State, and have developed into
keen traders and collectors of jungle produce.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sekrangs, with the exception of one outbreak,
noted on page <a href='#Page_381'>381</a>, for which a treacherous Government
chief was solely responsible, have been as peaceable and
law-abiding as the Saribas. These, with the Undups and
Balaus, ever the faithful friends of the Government and the
bravest—"a more plucky and sterling set of bull-dogs there
is not to be found," the Rajah wrote of the former many
years ago—are now the best-disposed people in the State.
With them perhaps may be included the Lemanaks, and the
Engkaris, who, however, have not gained for themselves the
same character for straightforwardness. The Ulu Ai are
alone the peace-breakers. Physically these men are the
finest of all, but are coarser in manners and not so brave.
All these tribes, with the exception of the Undups and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>Balaus, having greatly multiplied, have spread over Sarawak,
and become much mingled.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/p376.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>THE SARAWAK RANGERS.<br /><br />With the exception of the Band (Philippines and Malays) and three Sergeants, the men shown here are all Sea-Dayaks. The battalion is composed of some 275 Sea-Dayaks, 100 Sepoys, 50 Malays, 25 Javanese, and 20 Philippine bandsmen, under an English Commandant and an Instructor (shown). The force was established in 1846 under a native officer of the Ceylon Rifles.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Besides being very intelligent, the Sea-Dayaks are
wonderfully energetic and hard-working. They are thrifty,
eager to become well-off, are honest, and have few vices; but
they lack channels for their energy. Regular employment
in their own country by the establishment of industries, such
as plantations and mines, would do more for their redemption
from savagery than years of labour among them by officials
and missionaries. At present, their energies are almost
entirely confined to working jungle-produce; though to seek
this, they have now to go into the far interior, and this is often
the cause of their getting into trouble with remote and wild
tribes; they go also to North Borneo, Dutch Borneo, Sumatra,
the Malay peninsula, and even as far as Mindanau, in the
Philippines. These countries they visit in large numbers, and
abroad their honesty and energy have gained them a good
character. Many Dayaks place the money they have saved
with the Chinese on interest; some have erected shops,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>which they let for rent; but with most the prevailing idea
of riches is an accumulation of old jars and brassware.
There is no man keener on the dollar than the Dayak, or
keener upon retaining it when gained; and there is no
better labourer, but the employer of Dayak labour must be
tactful and just. As they become more prosperous they
discover for themselves that it is more conducive to their
welfare not only to be on good terms with the Government,
but at peace with their neighbours.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>SARAWAK RANGERS IN MUFTI.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Dutch in the Kapuas have experienced considerable
difficulty in dealing with the many tribes of different races,
especially with the Sea-Dayaks, who inhabit that vast river,
which runs past the heads of the Batang Lupar and the
principal left-hand branches of the Rejang river, but they
have made some advance in the pacification of these people,
though their methods are very different, far less energetic
and much slower, than those of the Rajah.</p>

<p class='c000'>The highlands, the spine of Borneo, along which runs the
frontier, is no mountain ridge, but a broken upland district,
that forms the watershed of the great rivers of Sarawak on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>one side, and the still greater rivers of Dutch Borneo on the
other. It is a region difficult of access from the coast on both
sides, and long after the Dayaks living lower down had
become peaceful, turbulence and internecine warfare remained
chronic in the interior. And this was the more difficult to
suppress because the aggressors had but to step across the
boundary, where they could not be pursued by the forces
of the Rajah. This was perfectly well understood by these
savages, and was taken advantage of repeatedly, and the
efforts of the Rajah were in consequence continually thwarted.</p>

<p class='c000'>A series of expeditions was planned by his Highness
that for this reason met with but partial success. It is
unnecessary to record the details of each, for each repeated
the experience of the former with painful iteration, and we
have already given an account of some of the earliest of these
punitive expeditions. But it will be necessary to record them,
to show how great were the difficulties the Government had
to contend with before the turbulent tribes of the interior
could be brought to submission.</p>

<p class='c000'>A great many of the Ulu Ai Dayaks had settled in the
Katibas river, which is the highway from the Rejang to
the Kapuas river in Dutch territory, and these Dayaks
were incessantly giving trouble by making predatory raids
against their enemies over the border.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dutch had complained of this, and the Rajah had
attacked them in 1870, as we have recorded, but as they
continued to give trouble, he again attacked them, for the third
time, in July 1871, taking them on this occasion completely
by surprise; and driving their chief, Unjup, over the frontier,
where he might have been captured. Unjup was the brother
of the powerful chief Balang, who had been previously
executed for plotting against the Government.<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c011'><sup>[328]</sup></a> Later on he
was allowed to return, and was pardoned on making humble
submission. He subsequently became a Government chief or
pengulu, but he was a useless character. After the third
attack, this tribe was moved to the lower waters of the
Katibas, and an interval of uninhabited jungle was put
between them and their enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>However, what is born in the bone must come out in the
flesh, and, in 1874, they again broke away and attacked, on
this occasion the Tamans and Bunut Malays of the Kapuas.
It was, however, a case of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex talionis</span></i>; and these people had
brought it upon themselves by their own treacherous conduct
in inveigling six Dayaks, who were on a peaceful visit to
their country, into a Taman house, where they were seized
and bound. Thence these six had been sent to Bunut, a
large Malay settlement, and were there put to death in a most
cold-blooded manner. Nevertheless the Dayaks had to be
taught not to take the law into their own hands. But
properly the Netherlands officials were the most blameworthy
for not having promptly secured and punished the Malay
murderers and their accomplices.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following year the Batu Bangkai Dayaks of the
Kapuas, in conjunction with some Katibas Dayaks, made a
determined attack on the Lemanak Dayaks. The Lemanak
is a confluent of the upper waters of the Batang Lupar. The
repeated outbreaks of these turbulent natives was entirely due
to their proximity to the Dutch frontier, and to their knowledge
that they had but to step across the border to escape the
Government forces; and at that time the Netherlands Government
insisted upon the border rights being strictly respected;
moreover their troops, the only forces they had at their
disposal, were totally useless in acting against Dayaks, who
can only be tracked by fellow Dayaks. The Netherlands
officials in the Kapuas were themselves aware of their
inability, and were averse to the policy of their Government.
Powerless themselves, unwilling or unable to use
Dayak auxiliaries, they were well content to let the Rajah
do the work for them which they could not do themselves.
But the central Government objected.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ulu Ai Dayaks of the upper Rejang, after having
been peaceable for many years, were encouraged by these
circumstances to break out again, and even those who were
disposed for peace were terrorised into joining in these forays
by a threat of having their houses burnt down over their
heads, unless they came out upon the war-path.</p>

<p class='c000'>In October, 1875, the Rajah led a large force against the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>upper Batang Lupar Dayaks, who had been giving great
trouble, and forty of their villages were destroyed; but deeming
this punishment inadequate, the attack was followed up
by another delivered two months later; the rebels, completely
surprised, suffered severely, and hastened to tender
their submission.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>KAPIT FORT—REJANG RIVER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The turn of the Katibas was to follow shortly. The
Kapuas Dayaks over the border were still unchecked, and
knowing how incapable the Dutch officials were to subdue
them, and secure as they believed themselves to be behind the
frontier, they became insolent, and in February collected a
large force of over 2000 fighting men to punish the Dayaks
up the Batang Lupar for having submitted to the Rajah.
They came within two hours' march of Lobok Antu fort,
but here they found the Resident of the district at the
head of a large force blocking their way. The Dutch <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Controleur</span>
in vain endeavoured to persuade these Dayaks to
disperse and return to their homes; and they had the
insolence to send the Resident an intimation that they
would do so if he paid them a fine of eight old jars, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>declared that if this were refused, they would attack Lobok
Antu in force. As the Resident could not cross the border
to punish them, this was just what he wanted them to do,
and he was perfectly prepared to give them a hot reception.
But they changed their minds and withdrew, leaving him
greatly disappointed that he had not been able to administer
to them a much-needed chastisement.</p>

<p class='c000'>But these Dayaks were not to be allowed to play fast and
loose much longer, for towards the end of 1876, the Resident
of Western Borneo administered a severe lesson to the rebels,
destroying all their villages and killing a great number
of the men. His expedition, conducted with vigour and
thoroughness, was completely successful.</p>

<p class='c000'>In October, 1876, the Rajah for the fourth and last time
attacked the Katibas Dayaks with a small force of about
a thousand Dayaks and Malays. This led to the submission
of these people, and they were forced to leave the
Katibas river, and move to the main river. Since then no
Dayaks have been allowed to live on the Katibas, and from
the Rejang side the border troubles almost ceased.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in 1879, led away by their principal chief, Lang
Endang (the Hovering Hawk), a Government pengulu, the
Sekrang Dayaks prepared to attack their old enemies,
the Kantu Dayaks, in Netherlands Borneo. They were
prevented in time, information of their purpose having
been conveyed to the Government. Their war-prahus were
destroyed, and a heavy fine was imposed upon them.
Lang Endang, whilst professing loyalty to the Government,
was secretly inciting the Sekrangs to resist, and
they refused to pay the fine. Lang Endang offered to
attack the recalcitrants if a party of Malays was sent
to support him, but, as the Government was well aware
that treachery was meditated, the offer was declined.
Acting under instructions from headquarters, the Resident
entered the Sekrang at the head of a large body of Malays
and Kalaka, Saribas and Batang Lupar Dayaks in April.
Lang Endang had assured the Government that he would
not allow the Sekrangs to make a stand in his district, but
at the same time he had collected them secretly around his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>long-house, and his plan was to fall on the Government
<em>bala</em> and take it by surprise. This he succeeded in doing.
A large horde of armed savages surrounded the punitive
force and attacked it, but the Sekrangs were badly worsted
and lost many killed and wounded; the Government
forces advanced, driving the rebels before them, and Lang
Endang's village was burnt to the ground. The Sekrangs
then submitted, paid the fine, and deposited pledges for
future good behaviour. Lang Endang was declared an
outlaw. He was driven from one place to another, and
although he was burnt out several times, he managed to
escape with his life. Finally he was suffered to settle by
himself in the Kanowit, a broken-down old man, without
power to do more harm. The Sekrangs had for many
years been the Rajah's devoted followers; since this final
outbreak they have given no more trouble, and have
regained their good character.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the establishment of the fort at the mouth of the
Baleh, since removed down to Kapit in 1877, the Ulu Ai
Dayaks gradually moved into that river, and in 1880, it was
thickly populated by them. Scattered among the numerous
Dayak villages on this river were small parties of refractory
Dayaks, who had been guilty of several murders to obtain
heads, and with heads renown. Though the majority of the
Baleh Dayaks were well affected, and had no sympathy
with these young head-hunters, they refused to give them
up. Thereupon they were offered two alternatives, either
they must surrender these murderers, or else move from
the river to the lower waters and leave them and their
followers to their fate. They chose the latter alternative.
Then the refractory party retired up the Mujong branch
of the Baleh, and established themselves at the foot of a
lofty, precipitous mountain called Bukit Batu. Upon an
almost inaccessible crag of this they erected a stockade,
to which they could retreat in the event of being attacked,
and draw up their ladders after them. Here they considered
themselves to be secure from punishment, and in
a position to raid neighbouring tribes, carry off heads, and
to defy the power of the Rajah. To prevent this and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>to cut off their supplies, a stockade was built at the mouth
of the Mujong, and again another at the mouth of the
branch stream that flowed from the mountain. A few were
intimidated and came in, but the rest, though they suffered
great privations, held out and evinced their determination not
to surrender by cutting off three Malays, who incautiously had
left the upper stockade to go fishing. They were attacked
by the Rajah in February, 1881, several were killed, and
their houses were burnt down; but this punishment proving
ineffectual, the Rajah again attacked them in the following
September, when they suffered heavier losses. After this
second lesson they sent in their women and children as
hostages and tendered submission. Then Bukit Batu was
abandoned to its original inhabitants, the wild Punans; and
the Dayaks were not allowed to live any more in the Baleh.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1884, a large force of Seriang Dayaks from Netherlands
Borneo, under the leadership of pates, chiefs appointed
by the Dutch Government, attacked Padang Kumang, also
on the Dutch side, killing nine and wounding five more, and
in this expedition they were joined by a Batang Lupar Ulu
Ai chief, Ngumbang, with 300 followers. A heavy fine was
imposed upon Ngumbang, and he was ordered to remove
farther down the river, where he could be closely watched.
He refused to pay and to move, on the plea that the Dutch
Dayaks had been the originators and leaders of the raid,
and that he did not see why punishment should fall on his
head, whereas they were allowed to go scot free. Similar
attacks continued to be made, not only on the Kapuas side
of the frontier, but also upon the Lemanaks and Sekrangs
on the Sarawak side, and the whole of this part of the
country was in a ferment and disorder. On Kadang ridge,
upon the border, and in its vicinity, numbers of unruly Ulu
Ai Dayaks had settled, some on one side, some on the
other, taking advantage of their position to slip across when
fearing molestation. These Dayaks were being continually
augmented by impetuous young bloods eager to acquire
reputation for bravery. Nothing could be done to reduce
them without the consent, if not the co-operation, of the
Dutch authorities, and the Rajah applied to the Netherlands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>Government to permit him to disregard the border, for this
once at least. And as this hornet's nest had become a menace
to the peaceful in Dutch Borneo as well as in Sarawak,
consent was given.</p>

<p class='c000'>In March, 1886, the Rajah advanced against Kadang
with a large force of 12,000 men. The whole country in the
vicinity of Kadang on both sides of the frontier was laid
waste; eighty villages were burnt, and although the rebels
made no determined stand, many were killed or wounded.
This expedition was eminently successful, as it not only
resulted in the submission of the rebel Dayaks on the
Sarawak side, including the chief Ngumbang, but also caused
consternation among those over the border, who found that
they were no longer safe there, and they were prepared to
submit to any conditions the Rajah might impose upon
them, rather than incur the risk of another attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>In appreciation of the signal services rendered to the
country under his control by the success of this expedition,
in September, 1886, the Netherlands Resident of Western
Borneo wrote to the Rajah:—</p>

<p class='c013'>Yesterday I received from the Comptroller the important
information that the last inhabitants of Bukit Kadang, who till
now have refused to submit, have been taken prisoners and brought
to Sintang,<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c011'><sup>[329]</sup></a> where they will be tried before the competent judge.
On Netherlands Territory in the frontier lands there are now
no more rebellious Batang Lupars. Whilst congratulating you
once more, dear Rajah, with this result, being due to the success
of your expedition, I assure you that my functionaries will always
earnestly co-operate for the conclusion of the Batang Lupar
question.</p>

<p class='c000'>The united efforts of the Netherlands and Sarawak
Governments have done much towards suppressing the
border troubles. A clear understanding has been arrived at
in regard to the mutual management of these turbulent
Ulu Ai Dayaks. The Netherlands and Sarawak officials
frequently correspond and meet to discuss arrangements,
and the assistance afforded by the former has been fully
recognised and acknowledged in the pages of the <cite>Sarawak
Gazette</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>Not only in connection with these particular border-troubles,
but in all other matters, the relations between the
two Governments have for years past invariably been
conducted in a spirit of mutual consideration and support,
and with a wholesome absence of red-tapeism.</p>

<p>FORT ALICE, SIMANGGANG.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>On June 27, 1888, in Lobok Antu fort, peace was
formally made in the presence of the Netherlands and
Sarawak officials, with the usual ceremonies of pig-killing
between the Ulu Ai Dayaks and the Malohs of Kapuas,
thus bringing to an end a feud that had existed for many
generations, and at the same time peace was made between
the Ulu Ai and the Kantu Dayaks of Kapuas. A similar
peace between the Ulu Ai of the Rejang and the Malohs
and Tamans had been concluded at Kapit fort a short time
before.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a long term of peace, in 1890, five young Ulu Ai
Dayaks, whilst on a visit to the Kapuas, came across and
killed eight Bunut Malays, but bearing in mind the former
act of treachery of these Malays, the people had no
sympathy with the victims; however, the chiefs averted
serious consequences to their country by themselves arresting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>the murderers and surrendering them to the Government
for punishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>In March of the same year, some Dayaks from Samunok,
on the Dutch side, made a raid into Sarawak territory and
killed twelve Kunjong Dayaks on their padi-farm. Two of
these murderers were killed by Dutch soldiers, and a heavy
fine was imposed on the rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The district watered by the great Rejang river, after
which it is named, is, regarding it from a political point of
view, the most important one in the State; and, owing to
its large and diversified population, is the most difficult
to govern. It contains about half the native population of
Sarawak. Into it the Sea-Dayaks have spread from the
Batang Lupar, and in a lesser degree from the Saribas,
and have so multiplied that in numbers they now far
exceed those in the adjacent districts of Kalaka, Saribas,
and Batang Lupar together, without any diminution in the
Sea-Dayak population of these districts, which has for years
been steadily increasing.<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c011'><sup>[330]</sup></a> Besides the many Kenyahs and
Kayans, more numerous than they are in the Baram, scattered
over the interior are the more aboriginal and wilder tribes, such
as the Punans, the Ukits, the Bukitans, and others not found
elsewhere than in the Rejang. In the old days these tribes
were at feud with each other, and all were at feud with the
Dayaks. The intertribal feuds between themselves have
been brought to an end, but those between them and
the Dayaks keep on breaking out spasmodically. These
are old blood-feuds, which undoubtedly originated with
the interior tribes, and arose probably from an instinctive
fear of the gradual advance of a more dominant race into
their country, and from a not unnatural desire to check it.
So far as the main population of the Sea-Dayaks is concerned
these feuds have long ceased, but with the Ulu Ai Dayaks of
the Rejang, those living on the head-waters, brought as they
are by their situation in contact with these interior tribes,
the case is different. The Ulu Ai Dayaks have not always
been the aggressors, even in recent times, but of late it has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>been mainly due to their vindictiveness that all attempts
to put an end to these feuds have been frustrated. For this
the young men have been mostly to blame, who, when away
in the remote interior collecting jungle produce, and beyond
even the weak control of their own chiefs, meeting with
detached parties of their old foes take such opportunities
of gaining renown as warriors, which awaits the return of
a Dayak with a head trophy, however meanly obtained.
Indiscriminate retaliation follows in the train of these acts, the
victims being the first Dayaks met with, nearly always men
guiltless of any hostile act, and often peaceable produce
collectors from other parts of the country. So fresh feuds
are established. Several wanton crimes of this nature
committed by the Dayaks of the Upper Rejang led to their
being attacked by the Rajah in May, 1894, all other forms
of punishment, even the extreme penalty of death, having
failed to deter them from repeating these acts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ulu Ai Dayaks have always been the most troublesome,
and, as we have pointed out, are now the sole
offenders. Not only are these people at enmity with the
alien tribes above them, and those inhabiting the head-waters
of the Mahkam (Koti), the Batang Kayan (Belungan),
and the Kapuas, but also with the Dayaks living below
them. Yet they have their redeeming points, especially
those of the upper Rejang, who are a hard-working people.
Many thousands of dollars worth of gutta-percha, india-rubber,
and rattans annually pass from their hands to the
Chinese traders, and the bulk of the jungle produce
exported comes from the Rejang. The money so earned by
them is not always converted into useless old jars and
brassware, the usual outward signs of richness amongst
Dayaks, but is placed with the Chinese on interest, and
upon good security; and in such transactions the Dayaks
are safeguarded by a Government regulation, which they are
careful to see is not evaded.</p>

<p class='c000'>After several years of tranquillity, in 1897 troubles again
arose in the Batang Lupar. An Ulu Ai named Bantin, a
man of no rank, collected a few kindred restless and badly
disposed Dayaks, and, under the pretence of wrongs, more or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>less imaginary, done to him and his people in former times,
made several petty raids against Dayaks living farther
down-river. Trifling as the successes were that he obtained
they were sufficient to gain for him renown as a leader, and
not only the addition of more followers, but the co-operation
of a few chiefs living in his neighbourhood,—turbulent
characters who had been subdued before, but who were
only waiting for a favourable opportunity to break out again.
The people were attacked in March, 1897, and, amongst
others, Bantin's eldest son was killed. A few months later
he was severely handled again for attacking some Dayaks
living below Lobok Antu, and this lesson was apparently
sufficient to keep his hands off his neighbours for a few
years.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in March, 1902, he again broke out, and on two
occasions attacked inoffensive Dayaks below Lobok Antu,
killing four; and this led to perhaps the most tragic event
that the annals of Sarawak record.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah at once organised an expedition with the
object of crushing and scattering this nest of rebels. To do
this successfully a large force was necessary to block all
roads by which the rebels could escape, especially those
leading over the border; but, unfortunately, an unprecedented
number of Dayaks, some 12,000, turned out at the bidding
of their Ruler, far more than were wanted or expected.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving Simanggang Fort on June 9, under the command
of Mr. H. F. Deshon, the Resident of the 3rd Division,<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c011'><sup>[331]</sup></a>
with whom was the Rajah Muda and Mr. D. J. S. Bailey, the
Resident of Batang Lupar and Saribas,<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c011'><sup>[332]</sup></a> the force reached
Nanga Delok on the 12th. Here the boats were to be left,
and the <em>bala</em> was to march inland in divisions. With a
company of Rangers, a strong and well-equipped body of
Malays, and an overwhelming force of Dayaks success seemed
assured; but a foe more dreadful than any human enemy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>attacked the camp, and in a few hours had claimed many
victims. Cholera had broken out, and rapidly spread.
Panic-stricken, with their dead<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c011'><sup>[333]</sup></a> and dying, the Dayaks at
once turned their bangkongs homewards, and by mid-day of
the 14th, of 815 boats that had collected at Nanga Delok,
but nineteen remained, with the Malay contingent, and the
Rangers, who lost eight of their comrades, and their senior non-commissioned
officer. Of the small force of Dayaks who had
so bravely stood by their leaders, only a hundred, or under one
half, were available for service. These, under their plucky
leader, the Pengulu Dalam, attempted to effect something,
but the rebels had retreated farther than they dared follow,
and after burning a few houses in the vicinity they were
compelled to retreat to their boats. Then the small remnant
of the expedition returned, passing on their way down many
empty boats, and other gruesome testimony of the sad havoc
caused by the cholera, to which it was subsequently ascertained
at least one thousand had fallen victims.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bantin was soon on the war-path again, harassing the
lower Dayaks on a larger scale than before. Mr. Bailey
twice attacked him, on the first occasion burning twenty-four
villages, and forty on the second, in co-operation with a
<em>bala</em> from the Rejang under Pengulu Dalam, when many of
the rebels were killed, but these punishments failed to bring
Bantin and his band to their senses.</p>

<p class='c000'>An expedition led by the Rajah in March, 1903, the last
one he has led in person, resulted in submission; it, however,
proved but hollow, having been made by the rebels to gain
time to recover from their losses. In February the following
year, during the Rajah's absence in England, the Rajah Muda
was compelled to attack these rebels again; and, though
this expedition was successful, another had to be despatched
against them in June. On this occasion a column led by
Mr. J. Baring-Gould<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c011'><sup>[334]</sup></a> was attacked by the rebels, who were
driven off with a heavy loss. Nearly fifty long-houses were
destroyed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>Then a large party of these wild Ulu Ai Dayaks of the
Rejang and Batang Lupar settled upon Entimau hill near
the head of the Katibas, and there built a strong stockade,
but by a frontal attack delivered by the Pengulu Dalam,
quickly followed up by an attack from their rear under Pengulu
Merum, these rebels were driven out with a heavy loss.
They then retired to the head of the Kanowit, where they
were again severely handled by the Pengulu Dalam.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is sometime now since Bantin with many others finally
submitted to the Rajah at Kapit Fort; and though the peace
that followed lasted for some little time, other outbreaks have
occurred, though these have been less frequent and serious.</p>

<p class='c000'>By establishing outposts and so bringing these warlike
people more immediately under Government control it is
expected that they will now soon be brought into line with
the great majority of the Sea-Dayaks. But, though time
and circumstances may alter the nature of these semi-savages,
and head-hunting will gradually become less popular, as the
danger to those indulging in it is increased, still the savage
old Adam will remain dormant in the nature of the Sea-Dayaks
for many years to come, and at times must break
out, as surely, and for the same reason, as it does in other
parts of the world, and amongst far more civilised people;
as it will continue to do until the millennium.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a bright side to the picture, as there is to every
picture, and the dark spot is to be found in one corner only.
The total Sea-Dayak population may be computed at a little
under 120,000, and of these over 80 per cent are now a peaceable
and well-behaved people. Those with any real experience
of them can testify to their many and predominating good
qualities. Crime is rare amongst them; they are an easy
and a pleasant people to rule, and to associate with, being
by nature bright, intelligent, and kindly. "Untutored and
unaffected by extraneous influences, and consequently primitive,
simple, and natural, one can but be agreeably struck by
their kind and hospitable manners, and by the open welcome
offered when visiting them. And those well acquainted with
the better qualities of these people must reflect whether any
change that may be effected by civilisation and education
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>will ameliorate their manners and their mode of living, both
socially and morally, and will prove of any paramount or
real benefit to them. Education, so far as it involves improvement
in agriculture and crafts must be brought about in the
natural sequence of events, and as a simple consequence of
mixing with other and superior races. Such developments
will be slow, but they will be natural ones, ensuring changes
only for the good of, and acceptable to, the people, and therefore
beneficial, being better adapted and better in effect than
radical changes foreign to their minds and character." With
these words from the greatest authority upon these people,
we will conclude our notice of the Sea-Dayaks.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Of the Kayans, Kenyahs, and other inland tribes, there
is little to be said. Troubles amongst these people have
rarely occurred; and occasional outbreaks have been the
result of anger caused by injuries suffered, unaggravated by
any desire for heads. The Kenyahs and Kayans are more
disciplined than the Sea-Dayaks, and better subject to the
control of their chiefs, amongst whom are to be found some
fine characters. Notably such an one was the Kenyah chief,
Tama Bulan, of the Baram. Loyal, powerful, and intellectual,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>he rendered inestimable services in the introduction of order
into his country when it was acquired by the Government,
and he continued these services unabated until his death in
1906. It was his earnest desire that "the Rajah, and everybody
else, should know that the Kenyahs could be trusted
to carry out his instructions, and were as loyal to his Government
as any of his Dayaks;" and on the eve of his death,
old and enfeebled, at a large meeting of Kenyahs and Kayans,
he managed to deliver a short address of farewell, in which
he exhorted the people not to give trouble, and after his
death to remain loyal to the Rajah.<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c011'><sup>[335]</sup></a></p>

1870.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Ranee arrived
in the country which was to

she was soon to gain the

<p>KUCHING, LOOKING UP RIVER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>As the <em>Royalist</em>, on board which were the Rajah and
Ranee, rounded a tree-covered point, the lower suburbs of
the town opened up. On the right hand, Malay Kampongs,
set in groves of dark-foliaged fruit trees, enlivened
by groups of welcoming Malays on the verandahs and on
the banks, dressed in their best garments of bright colours,
and by little brown children sporting in the wash of the
steamer. Opposite, the Chinese sago factories, gay with
strips of Turkey-red cloth embossed with words of welcome,
and enveloped in the smoke of an incessant salute of
crackers and bombs. At the head of the long and broad
reach the river banks on both sides rise to small hills, as if
guarding the entrance to the main town. At the foot of
the hill on the left are the Borneo Company's offices and
godowns,<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c011'><sup>[336]</sup></a> above, their bungalows set in deep verdure. On
the hill opposite, where now Fort Margherita domineers over
the town like a castle with its square tower and flanking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>turrets, were the Residency (now the Commandant's house)
and the barracks. Rounding the bend between these hills,
the main town, seated on the banks of a broad stretch of
river, broke into view, the Chinese bazaars, or town, and the
public buildings on the left, with the old white fort (now the
jail) on the point above. On the right, the Astana, or
palace, standing in park-like gardens amid tall palms and
other trees. On both banks above are the upper Malay
Kampongs, and in the distant back-ground the jungle-clad
range of Matang in sapphire blue, rising to the noble peak
of Serapi.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bazaars were gaily decorated in the showy and
profuse fashion affected by the Chinese, and the native
shipping—brigs, schooners, junks, and prahus of all descriptions—were
gay with bunting, the ensign of Sarawak
predominating, and here and there the red, white, and blue
flag of the Netherlands; the Natuna flag, black with a white
canton; and the triangular mercantile flag of China, a green
three-clawed dragon on a yellow ground. From the British
Consulate only flapped in the light wind the Union Jack.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the <em>Royalist</em>, with the Rajah's flag flying at the main,
steamed slowly up to her anchorage, the booming of cannon
announced to the people far and wide the return of their
Ruler with his bride, and simultaneously with the first gun,
down the whole length of the town burst forth a deafening
crash of crackers and bombs—the Chinese time-honoured
method of saluting.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the parade-ground, led by the Commandant,
defiled a line of white uniformed Rangers, with black facings
and belts, the guard of honour marching to the Astana.
The Siamese state-barge<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c011'><sup>[337]</sup></a> manned by Rangers, and with the
Resident on board, shot alongside to convey their Highnesses
ashore, and, as they landed, an orderly<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c011'><sup>[338]</sup></a> unfurled the symbol
of sovereignty—the large yellow umbrella.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the Astana landing-place were all the English
residents, Malay chiefs, the leading Chinese, and a few
Indian merchants. A bright picture this assembly presented,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>with the handsome uniforms of the officials, the rich-coloured
robes and turbans of the hajis, and the loose silk costumes
of the Chinese. Above was seen a knot of brown Dayaks,
the men wearing long decorated waistcloths of gay colours,
black leglets and ivory armlets; the women in short
petticoats fringed with silver coins, and in all the splendour
of their brass and copper corselets, armlets, anklets, and
coronets, burnished and sparkling in the sun.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a tear on his bronzed cheek, a tear of joy, the old
Datu Bandar,<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c011'><sup>[339]</sup></a> the worthy son of a gallant father, steps
forward to welcome his beloved Chief with his beautiful
bride, and his was not the least valued of the many fervent
greetings they received that day.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Rajah and Ranee passed on to the Astana the
Royal salute was given by the guard of honour in a manner
worthy of the best-drilled troops; but one thing was lacking,—a
national anthem,—and little did any one there present
dream that the accomplished lady then stepping for the
first time on Sarawak soil would shortly supply that want
by composing one for the country, which was to become so
dear to her.<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c011'><sup>[340]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Something must be said of the Astana,<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c011'><sup>[341]</sup></a> the residence of
the Rajah and Ranee, which had then just been completed.
It is built of brick in three separate sections, with a roof of
iron-wood shingles, in appearance closely resembling slates.
The illustration will best convey an idea of its exterior
appearance, which in the opinion of some has been sacrificed
for the sake of internal comfort. However that may be, no
more comfortable or cooler house exists in the East. On
the first or upper floor of the centre section are the drawing-rooms
and dining-room, spacious and lofty, and surrounded
by a broad verandah. At the back of the house, off the
dining-room, is the library. The side blocks contain the
bedrooms, the lateral verandahs of which are connected with
those of the central block by covered bridges. In the basement
are the Rajah's office, guard-room, household offices,
bathrooms, etc. The entrance is in the tower, in the lower
part of which is the main staircase, and above is the billiard
room. In a separate building, connected with the main
building by a covered passage, are the bachelors' quarters.</p>

<p>DINING-ROOM, ASTANA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>The well-laid-out gardens are extensive, and contain
many beautiful tropical plants. Behind the Astana is the
old graveyard of the former Malay Rajahs, in which are
some well-carved monuments of iron-wood. Beyond the
gardens are grazing lands. The Rajah has two cattle farms,
and he takes a great interest in rearing cattle, importing
pedigree bulls from England to improve the stock in the
country. Kuching is almost wholly supplied with milk and
butter from the Astana dairies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Above the Astana are Malay Kampongs, below, the fort
and barracks, and beyond these more Malay Kampongs.
On the opposite side of the river is the town, the upper part
of which is comprised of the principal Malay Kampongs,
where reside the datus; and these stretch along the river
for a mile on each side of the road which runs parallel with
it down to the Malay Mosque. This is a square building of
some dignity, with a pyramidical roof supported inside by
noble pillars, and near the mosque is the Datus' Court-house,
and one of the Government schools for Malays. Adjoining
this is the business portion of the town, substantially built
of brick, whitewashed and clean, which extends down to the
creek, from which the town takes its name, in two long
streets with cross-connecting streets. In the centre is the
Court-house with the Government offices; the markets are
on one side, and the jail on the other; behind are the Police
Station and the Government Dispensary. Beyond the
Kuching creek are the Borneo Company's offices and
godowns, above which, on the hill behind, are the houses of
the manager and his assistants. Beyond again another
Kampong, in which there are a good many houses of foreign
Malays and some Chinese, and this portion of the town
extends to the race-course. Between these and the river are
the sago factories.</p>

<p class='c000'>Behind the central portion of the town is the S.P.G.
Mission ground, upon which are the church, Bishop's House,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>and Vicarage, the Boys' and Girls' Schools, and the Public
Library. On the opposite side of the road is the esplanade
with the band-stand, and beyond the police barracks. Then,
landwards, are bungalows, club-houses, the Museum, and the
Residency, behind which is another Malay Kampong, and
farther on the Roman Catholic church, convent, and schools,
and beyond these the golf links. The town reservoirs and
the General Hospital are beyond the S.P.G. Mission ground.
Dotted about in the suburbs are the houses and bungalows
of Europeans and well-to-do Chinese, standing in pleasant
gardens, and intermingled with these are the humbler homes
of Chinese and Malay gardeners.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>THE ESPLANADE, KUCHING.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Kuching is well supplied with roads, and is the only
town in Borneo in which wheel-traffic is general. It has
practically an inexhaustible water-supply, the water being
brought down in pipes a distance of 11 miles from
Matang mountain, a work lately completed at great cost.
It has a telephone service, which extends to upper Sarawak,
and which will be gradually extended along the coast to all
the principal out-stations. The town is lighted with Lux
lamps. Its public buildings are well constructed and
adequate for their purposes. In addition to the Mission
schools are three Government schools, of which notice shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>be made in a following chapter. The Museum is a handsome
building, and contains both an ethnographical and a natural
history collection, which have gained a wide reputation.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1839, Kuching was nothing but a small collection of
wooden thatched hovels, now it is one of the largest towns
in Borneo, if not the largest, and is commercially the most
important. On pages <a href='#Page_61'>61</a> and <a href='#Page_91'>91</a> will be found illustrations
showing what Kuching was then, and what it is now.
Then, Bruni, though fast declining from its former prosperous
state, was in a far more flourishing condition than Kuching,
which had been reduced to desolation by oppression. Fifty
years later an anonymous writer, evidently a naval officer,
after giving a good account of Bruni and its circumstances,
wrote:—</p>

<p class='c013'>When we left we could not but draw an unfavourable contrast
between the ancient town and the young capital of the adjacent
State of Sarawak, Kuching, which we had lately visited. There,
under European rule, the jungle has been cleared, and a well built
and planned town has sprung up, with good roads, handsome public
buildings, an efficient police—all the essentials of civilisation in fact;
Malays, Dayaks, and Chinese live and trade amicably together, and
all the resources of a rich country are being opened up; while the
river-banks are beautified with picturesque bungalows nestling among
the trees, with green lawns, such as one rarely sees out of England,
stretching down to the water's edge.<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c011'><sup>[342]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On September, 21, 1870, was born to the Rajah a
daughter, Ghita, and on February 20, 1872, twin sons, James
and Charles. The birth of these sons was a cause of general
rejoicing among the natives of all classes in Kuching; but
Ghita, a very charming child, was the principal pet among the
Malays, who entertained a lively and tender affection for her,
which she reciprocated, for the little girl seemed to be never
so happy as when in their company.</p>

<p class='c000'>In August, 1872, the Rajah and Ranee visited Pontianak,
where they met with a very cordial reception by the Dutch
Resident, Mr. Van der Shulk, and the civil, naval, and
military officers; in November, in the same year, they paid a
visit to the Governor-General of Batavia, by whom they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>also most cordially received. The Dutch had long since
given up their expectation and hope of acquiring Sarawak.</p>

<p class='c000'>In September, 1873, the Rajah and Ranee left for England,
leaving the administration of the country in the hands
of Mr. J. B. Cruickshank and a Committee of Administration.</p>

<p class='c000'>In ascending the Red Sea in the <em>Hydaspes</em> the heat was
intense.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>All in a hot and copper sky,</div>
      <div class='line'>The bloody sun at noon</div>
      <div class='line'>Right up above the mast did stand,</div>
      <div class='line'>No bigger than the moon.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The poor children, parched, panting, struck with heat
apoplexy, died one after another. James on October 11,
Ghita on October 14, and Charles on October 17, and were
committed to the deep.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah was created a Commander of the Crown of
Italy in April, 1874, and in July, 1899, was promoted to be
Grand Officer.</p>

<p class='c000'>On September 26, 1874, Charles Vyner, the Rajah Muda,
was born. The name Vyner was taken from Sir Thomas
Vyner, Lord Mayor of London in 1654, who entertained
Oliver Cromwell in the Guildhall. His only son, Sir Robert
Vyner, on the contrary was a zealous Royalist, and sacrificed
some wealth for the cause of the King, and being also in turn
Lord Mayor, entertained King Charles II. in 1670. He had
been created a baronet, but the baronetcy became extinct in
his only son, George, and then the estate of Eastbury in Essex,
purchased by the profit of the old Puritan's merchandise,
passed to the two daughters of the grandson, the founder of
the family, and from one of them, Edith, the Brookes claim
descent, through Elizabeth Collet, great-great-granddaughter
of Edith, who married a Captain Robert Brooke (son of
Robert Brooke of Goodmansfields, London), and Mr. Thomas
Brooke, father of the first Rajah, was their grandson.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst the Rajah was in England, the late Lord Derby
was at the Foreign Office. He was always very friendly
towards Sarawak, and paid the Rajah the compliment of saying
that the British Government could never have made such
a success of Sarawak, as he had done. This was a fact <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>saute aux yeux</span></i> of all such as knew anything of Foreign
Office and Colonial Office ways, but it was none the less
satisfactory that the obvious truth should be admitted. Lord
Derby and Lord Clarendon were the only two Foreign
Secretaries who displayed any appreciation of the work that
was being done in Sarawak, and who did not consider its
Ruler as beneath their notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord Grey, formerly Secretary for Colonial Affairs, and
the reformer of Colonial administration, was another Minister
who extended his sympathies towards Sarawak, and continued
to do so long after he had ceased to hold office. In 1894, a
few years before his death, he wrote to the Rajah, "Though I
do not remember ever having had the advantage of meeting
you, the long friendship with your uncle, which I enjoyed,
induces me to write you a few lines for the purpose of
expressing the great pleasure with which I have read the
account of the present state of Sarawak in the <cite>Pall Mall
Gazette</cite>. From the first, as you may be aware, I have taken
a deep interest in the work done by Sir James Brooke in
Borneo, and have never ceased to follow up the history of the
Settlement he formed. I am glad to learn how wisely and
successfully you have been carrying on his work, and it has
been a great satisfaction to me to read the account of the
continued prosperity of your little State." Little in regard to
population perhaps, but as large in area as the four Federated
Malay States along with Johore.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah and Ranee returned to Sarawak in June,
1875, and were received with demonstrations of the greatest
joy, but at the same time with tokens of sincere sympathy
for their loss.</p>

<p class='c000'>The difficulties that the Rajah had to overcome in
suppressing the many intertribal feuds still existing among
the thousands of warlike natives, of so many different tribes
and races, comprising the interior population of Sarawak,
receive illustration from the grievances presented to him on
his visiting Baleh fort in the same year. This fort was 180
miles up the Rejang, and had been constructed during his
absence in England. It has since been moved down to
Kapit.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>The complaints made were these:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Uniat, a Kayan chief, complained that fourteen of his
women and children, among the latter two of his own, had
been killed by the Poi Dayaks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Kanian, a Dayak chief, complained of six of his people
having been killed by Kayans of the Tinjar (Baram) then in
Bruni territory. No redress could be promised in such a
case as this.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>THE GENERAL HOSPITAL, KUCHING.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Apai Bansa, a Dayak, brought as his grievance that
seven of his people had been murdered by Lisums, a wild
tribe living far in the interior. In this case also, the Rajah
was not in a position to afford help.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ingan, a Dayak, complained about the murder of his
father and fifteen companions, by Pieng Kayans of the
Mahkam or Koti in Dutch territory.</p>

<p class='c000'>Madang, a Dayak, complained that one of his followers
had been murdered by another Dayak.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among other matters gone into was the attack in force
of Rejang Dayaks upon the Tamans and Bunut Malays of
the Kapuas, provoked by the treacherous and cold-blooded
murder of six Dayaks who had gone on a peaceful errand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>to that river to search for some lost relatives, who had been
captured by Tamans on a former raid. This matter has
already been referred to in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p class='c013'>If it has been found impossible in half a century to crush out
completely all traces of head-hunting in a country larger than Great
Britain and Ireland put together, one cannot forget that it is not so
many generations since the wild Highlander was seen descending
upon fold and shepherd, willing to risk his own life, and when needs
must be, to take that of another, provided he could but return to
his own filthy hovel, laden with spoil.</p>

<p class='c013'>All praise then be to those whom philanthropy has induced to
lend a helping hand to this once wretched spot, so long shut out
from civilising influence, and to those, who in the face of a life of
isolation and discomfort, are still found willing to grapple with
barbarism in its most hideous form—to him who rules the country,
whose entire life has been devoted to the interests of his people, as
is now that of his Ranee, beloved by all who know her; and let
him, too, be remembered whose genius, enterprise, and unselfishness
founded this plucky little kingdom of Sarawak, the good Sir James
Brooke, who died battling hard—as his successor still earnestly
strives—to instil into the minds of his wild subjects that beautiful
precept "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pax hominibus bonæ voluntatis.</span>"<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c011'><sup>[343]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On August 4, 1875, the Rajah wrote to the Netherlands
Resident of Western Borneo:—</p>

<p class='c013'>I fear the time has not yet arrived for peace in these inland
regions, and that years of disquiet will take place before these people
turn their minds entirely to peaceful pursuits, but I am fully aware
it is utterly beyond the power of any civilised power to put a stop
to the proceedings of these wild and unapproachable people</p>

<p class='c000'>—referring to the distant tribes living on the borders. "Time
and continual exertion must work out the problem of
improvement," was the opinion the Rajah expressed somewhat
later, who years before, whilst condemning arbitrary
measures, stated his opinion that "forbearance should not go
beyond a certain point in dealing with Dayaks, who have
the feelings of children; kindness and severity must proceed
hand in hand with such a people," and no better authority
upon the management of such people exists.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>On August 8, 1876, Bertram Willes Dayrell Brooke,
the Tuan Muda, was born.<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c011'><sup>[344]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Upon April 11, 1877, the Rajah had a very narrow escape
from drowning whilst ascending the Rejang, accompanied by
Messrs. M. G. Gueritz<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c011'><sup>[345]</sup></a> and Deshon, in a small Government
steamer, the <em>Ghita</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon approaching Baleh fort, a heavy fresh was coming
down the river Baleh, and, on attempting to cross this to
gain the anchorage in the main river, the steamer was driven
into the bank. She was almost pressed under water, and as a
general smash appeared imminent, the Rajah seized a branch,
hoping to swing himself ashore. It snapped, by the vessel
being rammed against it, and he was precipitated into a
whirlpool, which sucked him under and swept him away.
Fortunately, as he rose for the last time, a boat coming from
the fort was carried by the stream past him, he was laid
hold of, and pulled on board, unconscious from exhaustion.
Messrs. Gueritz and Deshon stuck to the steamer, which had
been forced on her beam ends, and had her funnel, awnings,
and stanchions torn off by the overhanging boughs. Nearly
all on board were forced into the current, but were saved
by the Dayak boats that came hurrying to the rescue.</p>

<p class='c000'>As is the case in these inland rivers, the force of the fresh
quickly subsided, and with the help of many willing Dayaks
the steamer was extricated from her perilous position and
towed to her anchorage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Harry Keppel Brooke, the Tuan Bongsu, was born on
November 10, 1879.</p>

<p class='c000'>In June, 1882, as already related in the preceding
chapter, the Rajah visited Bruni, and obtained from the
Sultan the cession of the districts lying between Kedurong
Point and the Baram.</p>

<p class='c000'>Owing to the disturbed condition of Limbang and Bruni,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>the Rajah left for England in September 1887, to watch the
interests of Sarawak, and to lay before the British Government
the true state of affairs in these places. He was
accompanied by the Ranee and their three sons, who had
joined him in Sarawak a few months previously. He wished
to impress upon the Government the real feelings of the
Limbang people in regard to annexation to Sarawak, and
to remove the impression that his Government had been
fostering discontent in the former place with a view to
encroachment. Before leaving Singapore, the Rajah wrote
the following note to Mr. F. R. O. Maxwell, in whose charge
the Government had been left:—</p>

<p class='c013'>Before leaving this for England, I must express my very sincere
gratification for the kind way all Europeans, Datus, and Natives
have received our sons in Sarawak. I can assure you and all, it has
given both the Ranee and myself great satisfaction, and we feel we
cannot be too thankful to the whole community for this mark of
their confidence and good feeling.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Rajah returned to Sarawak in May, 1888, and laid
before the Supreme Council a memorandum which had been
agreed upon by her Majesty's Cabinet Council granting
protection to Sarawak. Subject to one alteration, the
memorandum was accepted. This alteration was admitted
by the Cabinet Council, and on the 14th June, the agreement
affording British protection to the State was signed and sealed
by the Rajah in Council. This agreement acknowledges the
Rajah as the lawful Ruler of the State of Sarawak, which
shall continue to be governed and administered by him and
his successors as an independent State under the protection
of Great Britain, and confers no power on her Majesty's
Government to interfere with the internal administration
of the State. Any question arising respecting the succession
to the present or any future Ruler of Sarawak is
to be referred to her Majesty's Government for decision.
The foreign relations of the State are to be conducted by
her Majesty's Government, and in accordance with its
directions. Her Majesty's Government have the right to
establish British Consular officers in any part of the State,
but these are to receive exequaturs from the Rajah. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>confers the rights of the most favoured nations upon British
subjects, commerce, and shipping, and such rights and
privileges as may be enjoyed by the subjects, commerce, and
shipping of Sarawak. It, moreover, provides that no cession
or alienation of any part of the territory of Sarawak shall be
made to any foreign State, or to the subjects and citizens
thereof, without the consent of her Majesty's Government.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sarawak, for nearly fifty years, without protection,
assistance, or encouragement of any kind, had gone on her
way progressing slowly but surely, and maintaining her
independence in spite of many reverses and misfortunes;
and, long before the protection was granted, had developed
into a prosperous State with a bright future before her. For
her advancement and security, that protection which the late
Rajah had so ardently desired and so sorely needed, time
has shown was not really necessary. Could he have foreseen
this in the days of his country's adversity, he might have
spared himself many rebuffs from those who should have
upheld him in his noble work, but who chose either to flout
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>or to obstruct it. He was impressed with the conviction, not
unreasonably entertained, that the Dutch cast a lickerish eye
upon Sarawak, and he was afraid that, failing England,
Sarawak would have to fall back on the Netherlands
Government for help in the event of an insuperable
reverse or of bankruptcy. That would lead to the little
State being annexed to the Dutch possessions in the
island; and he was by no means confident that the British
Government would not allow this to take place. But since
that period, in the desire for colonial extension, which has
grown in foreign nations, appeared another danger to the
independence of the State, a danger which, if it arose, it
would have been impossible for its Ruler to have averted
unless protected, and state-craft offers many methods, and
has shown many examples of a strong power starting a
quarrel with one that is weak, that has led to annexation.
Consequently, for Sarawak protection was needed; and for
England it seemed to be imperative, to prevent a country in
such a commanding position and with so many conveniences
falling into the hands of a foreign power.<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c011'><sup>[346]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On August 15, 1889, the fiftieth anniversary of the
landing of Sir James Brooke, in a speech the Rajah said:—</p>

<p class='c013'>That he had had the honour, and perhaps the misfortune, to
figure in the Government through the greater portion of that time.
No country could traverse so long a period without great changes
taking place in her for better or for worse. A half century is long
enough to make or to break any nation or government, any man or
people. Fortunately, we are all here to witness the fact that Sarawak
has weathered the storms and escaped the breakers that were deemed
likely to wreck her. She rode safely to port, or, to change the
metaphor, she stood now, he believed, upon a surer and more solid
basis than ever before. He would not say that this country had
advanced with rapidity, though many might entertain a contrary
opinion, but we knew that we have been left to work out the problem
of government and development of commerce for ourselves, and, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>he might say so, to paddle our own canoe, with but scant assistance
from without. It was just that slow and gradual development—first
the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear—the law of
all healthy growth—which had taught us how to govern this country
with its many dusky races. There is give and take in all departments
of life, and the native inhabitants had taught us, and we had taught
them, till both ourselves and they had acquired, and he might say,
been saturated with perfect mutual confidence, the one with the other.
This perfect mutual confidence was the true basis on which the
prosperity and security of the State reposed, and none more solid
could be conceived; none of which all present had a greater right to
be proud. Nothing, he would venture to say, had been rushed or
pushed forward with inordinate precipitation, so as to cause reaction
or to injure the prospects of the future.</p>

<p class='c000'>Writing on the subject of Sarawak for the Geographical
Society of Australia, the French writer and explorer, Edmond
Cotteau, who visited Sarawak in 1884, says:—</p>

<p class='c013'>In reality thirty Englishmen, no more, govern and administer
economically the country, and that with only a few hundred native
soldiers and policemen, and almost without written laws. A handful
of men of a strange race is blindly obeyed by 300,000 Asiatics! To
what must we attribute this great result if not to the justice and the
extreme simplicity of the Government? What better example could
be followed in the future when the great island of New Guinea
becomes a dependency of some European Power?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>The Rajah was created a G.C.M.G. at the time that
protection was granted.</p>

<p class='c000'>In October, 1889, the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty, issued instructions that her Majesty's ships were
in future to salute the Rajah with twenty-one guns.</p>

<p class='c000'>His Highness left for England in October, 1889, again
to confer with the Foreign Office on the Limbang question,
and returned in February, 1890, when he at once proceeded
to Limbang, which river was annexed to Sarawak by him
on March 17. The events that led up to this step being
taken, and the reasons that induced the Rajah to take
them, have been fully explained in the chapter on Bruni.
Though it was evident to all with the smallest acquaintance
with Bornean affairs that the Rajah's action was purely
protective in the interests of the inhabitants of Limbang, and
was taken at their earnest desire; that it was even to the
advantage of Bruni itself, menaced as it was by the rebels in
the Limbang, the British Government having declined to
interfere, yet this action was generally condemned by the
English public, who knew nothing of the circumstances, and
regarded it as an injustice done to the Sultan, the very
person, and about the only person, against whom his subjects
needed protection. The British Government had offered the
Sultan assistance, but the acceptance of this would have
involved the appointment of a British Resident, and the
consequent adoption of a just Government; this did not in
anywise accord with the views of the Sultan. He then turned
to the Rajah, who was willing to assist him in bringing about
peace by peaceful means, but this also was not what the
Sultan wanted. An agreement exists between Bruni and
Sarawak that the latter shall help the former if troubles
beset her, but the Sultan's view, that Sarawak should reduce
the Limbang people to submission by force of arms and
subject them to a crushing tyranny, was not an interpretation
of this agreement which the Rajah could or would accept.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. L. V. Helms,<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c011'><sup>[347]</sup></a> a Dane, twice visited the Limbang
river a short time before its annexation, and he wrote:—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>I have come in contact with many of the principal chiefs, and
have heard from them a story of misrule which is a scandal even
in an Asiatic country, and should disentitle the rulers to be
considered a government, or to enjoy the rights and privileges as
such. When the subject has to abandon his house and property and
seek concealment in the jungle to avoid being robbed of his goods
and perhaps of his children by the Sultan and his menials, then they
rightly forfeit their position as rulers. The present state of things
in this river is very deplorable, and unjust to the natives, who sit
on the rail, uncertain who will be their master, anxious to give
allegiance to Rajah Brooke's government, but dreading lest they
should be handed back to their old taskmasters.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the sake of humanity it is to be hoped that this suspense
may soon be terminated by the transfer of the river to the Sarawak
Rajah's government, who may justly point to the history of Sarawak
and its position to-day as a good title to the last territory of a Ruler
who has long ceased to perform the duties of that office to his
subjects.</p>

<p class='c000'>On July 31, 1891, the Rajah, at a meeting of the
Council Negri, proclaimed his son, Vyner, as his successor,
whenever it should please God to take him hence; and
decreed that seven days after his own death the Rajah Muda
should be proclaimed Rajah of Sarawak. This duty he
entrusted to the members of Council, both European and
native, to see that it was solemnly carried out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having bought up some questionable rights over North
Borneo, which do not appear to have been utilised, granted by
the Sultan to some Americans in 1865, Mr. (now Sir Alfred)
Dent and Baron Von Overbeck, an Austrian, in 1877 and
1878, obtained from the Sultans of Sulu and Bruni the
cession of North Borneo, from the Sibuku river on the east
coast to the Kimanis on the west coast,<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c011'><sup>[348]</sup></a> a territory
containing some 30,000 square miles, with a population of
about 150,000; and this led to the formation of the
chartered British North Borneo Company in 1881.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the first few years of its administration, the
Company made such tardy advance towards the realisation
of the bright promises that had been held out by its
promoters, and the prospects before it being considered by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>many to offer but little hope of ultimate success, in 1893 it
was proposed by some persons interested in North Borneo,
that the country should be incorporated with Sarawak,
provided that the Rajah would guarantee to the shareholders
a small interest upon the capital paid up, to be increased
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro rata</span></i> with the increase of the revenue. The capital
invested was to be viewed in the light of a loan to the State,
and was to be paid off as the Rajah could find the means to
do so. The shareholders, however, had so great a faith
in the undeveloped resources of their property that they
declined to part with it. But, being sensible of the
benefit they would derive from the Rajah's influence and
experience in subjecting to order a people not altogether
satisfied with the new <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</span>, as also in establishing a form
of government adapted to them and to the conditions of the
country, they empowered their Directors to offer him the
position of Governor-General. Needless to say, the Rajah
could not accept this honour, and so the matter dropped.</p>

<p class='c000'>Had this measure been effected, whatever benefit the
northern State might have derived, it is obvious that it might
in many ways have proved detrimental to the interests of
Sarawak. An union of the two States would have ensured
economy in administration to British North Borneo, and
probably a more beneficial government to its people. This
was the opinion of Lord Brassey, himself a Director of the
Company, an opinion which appears to have been shared by
other Directors:—</p>

<p class='c013'>I hold strongly to the opinion, said his Lordship, that the
North Borneo Company would do well to hand over its territory to
Rajah Brooke. I believe the attempt to administer the affairs of the
country by a Board of Directors in London is simply hopeless. The
members of the Board have no local knowledge, they are entirely in
the hands of their local officers, and the tendency is to increase the
staff and create an expensive system of administration, which is not
suitable to the circumstances of the country. North Borneo is an
exceedingly poor country, and I see very little prospect for it. Rajah
Brooke is a man of responsibility and high standing in those parts
of Borneo, and would bring to bear upon the Government a life-long
personal experience. He has a deep knowledge of the Malay population,
with whom he has great influence. He could maintain an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>adequate authority with a much smaller staff of officials than we now
require. He would have no need of a system of police such as we
have created, consisting of Sikhs from the Army of India, who are
necessarily paid at a high rate. The cost of the Sikh police is far
beyond the resources of the country.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>North Borneo has prospered beyond Lord Brassey's
expectations; but the country is burdened with a heavy
debt.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in 1900, the veteran, the Hon. Sir Henry Keppel,
G.C.B., then Admiral of the Fleet, paid his final visit to
Sarawak. His last visit had been in 1867, and we have
noticed (Chap. III. p. <a href='#Page_89'>89</a>) how he had been impressed by
the changes he saw, but considerable as the progress had
then been, he must have found some difficulty in recognising
the town in 1900, and in discovering familiar landmarks.</p>

<p class='c000'>The regard and friendship which the old Admiral bore
for the late Rajah was extended to his "old friend and shipmate,"
the present Rajah, whom he has described as being
"quiet, reserved, and gentlemanlike, with a determination
not to be surpassed, and with a keen sense of justice—qualifications
fully appreciated by the chiefs."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>The last letter he wrote to the Rajah just before his
death three years later will be of interest to our readers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many thanks, my dear Rajah, for your kind letter. I was wondering
when or whether we were to meet again. I should like to see
my most promising Mid again and shake him by the hand before I
depart hence. Our late profession is disappearing, and few will ever
see or know what we knew. May you long live to increase doing
good, and few will have led a happier or more useful life.... Our
last meet was in London when you were off to the country to look
after your hunters, and with the coronation in view I hardly expected
to see you again. I am here enjoying the climate I love so well,
and care not at my age if I never return, but must I suppose put in
an appearance in England, although unfit to attend the coronation.
I am uncertain in my movements, and am afraid I shall be unable
to pay you a visit; and for the few months I may be allowed to live
I can form no future plans.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sarawak had no more faithful, no truer friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>Partly on account of her having to superintend the education
of her sons, and of having to make for them a home in
England, but mainly owing to her health rendering any long
sojourn in the tropics inadvisable, the Ranee has not been able
to reside in Sarawak for some years, a matter of deep regret
to all. Her last visit was one of six months, after an absence
of eight years, and of this visit the <cite>Sarawak Gazette</cite> says:
"universally popular as her Highness always has been
amongst all classes, her visit has done much to maintain and
increase the native contentment and appreciation of the rule
of an Englishman over the country." Indeed her presence
in Sarawak has always been greatly valued by all, natives
and Europeans alike. In the former she took the deepest
interest, an interest which has not been discontinued since
her departure from the country. To her the absence of most
of the pleasures and luxuries of a civilised life was more than
counterbalanced by the interests that occupied her time and
thoughts in her adopted country, and of her adopted people,
amongst whom she was always happy and at home, even
under trying circumstances. She was the moving spirit in
the promotion of the social and industrial welfare of the
women and children, and was always an honoured and
welcome guest at the social functions of the Malays, to whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>her receptions at the Astana were always open. Writing of
a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">levée</span> at the Astana, Beccari<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c011'><sup>[349]</sup></a> says:—</p>

<p class='c013'>It is pleasant to record the general reciprocity of good feeling
which is such a characteristic of the Sarawak community, cordially
uniting Europeans and natives in bonds of mutual consideration and
esteem. The barriers of race and rank are obliterated in this mutual
and cordial goodwill. Together with representatives of the people,
there was at the Astana a large sprinkling of the Malay aristocracy,
which has always shown itself faithful to the enlightened government
of the Brookes, even at the most critical times.</p>

<p class='c000'>In August 1897, having finished his education (Winchester
and Magdalene College, Cambridge) the Rajah Muda
permanently joined the Rajah's staff to learn the methods of
his government, and to gain a knowledge of the diversified
races over which he is destined to rule. After having spent
several years in the provinces as Resident of different districts,
on May 12, 1904, by proclamation the Rajah decreed that
the Rajah Muda should in future share his duties, and make
the capital his principal residence. He was to preside in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>the Courts of Law, with the reservation of right of appeal to
the Rajah; to take the Rajah's place in the Supreme and
General Councils, when the Rajah was not present or unable
to preside; the direction of out-station affairs was to be placed
in his hands; he was to conduct all office routine as the
Rajah had done; and he was entitled to use the Rajah's flag
and the yellow umbrella. The Rajah retained the initiative
control over the Treasury, Military, Naval, Police, and Public
Works Departments, and he made it known that in advancing
the Rajah Muda to a position in which he might share his
labours and to which he considered him to be entitled, he
did not lay down any of the rights or powers invested in
himself as Rajah.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since this the Rajah has divided his time between
Sarawak and England, spending the summer months in the
former country, chiefly on his yacht, visiting every corner of
it, and the winter months in the latter, where he passes his
time in hunting, a sport to which he is devoted. During his
absence from Sarawak the Government is administered by
the Rajah Muda.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sarawak continued to be a haven for those seeking to
escape from the shackles of oppression. We have already
recorded in Chapter XIII. how many of the subjects of the
Sultan of Bruni had taken refuge there; the people of the
Natuna Islands have done the same. These beautiful islands
are tributary to the Sultan of Rhio, and are under Dutch
control, though nominally so only, for the Sultan appears to
work his own will unchecked on the islanders through his
agents, who are periodically sent to the islands with the sole
object of gathering in what they can for the royal exchequer.
Accompanied by a large force, the Sultan's heir, Rajah Ali,
on one occasion, honoured the island with a visit, and found
pretext to relieve the Datu of Sirhasan (one of the largest
of these islands) of all his property, to the value of some
$3000, and to annex his cocoa-nut grove containing 6000
palms. Even a gold watch and a telescope, given to the
datu by the captain of a shipwrecked steamer as a return
for his hospitality to crew and passengers, were not spared.
A few years previously the same datu had been similarly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>plundered. If such were the treatment meted out to the
chiefs, the lot of the common people may well be supposed
to have been hopeless. They had none to complain to but
the Rajah, and he could help them in no other way than by
reporting their grievances to the Dutch authorities, who did
nothing. Any attempt on their part to lay their complaints
before the Resident at Rhio would have been frustrated, and
would have met with cruel chastisement.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have little more of public interest to record concerning
the history of the Raj and the lives of its Rajahs. The
commercial and industrial progress is dealt with in a later
chapter, and that will show the gradual development of the
country to its present prosperous condition, and the achievement
of an unique undertaking which has been carried into
effect slowly, but surely and with determination.</p>

<p class='c000'>We quote the following extract from Consul Keyser's
report to the Foreign Office for 1899:—</p>

<p class='c013'>This country (Sarawak) makes no sensational advances in its
progress. Reference to statistics, however, will prove that this progress
is sure, if slow, and each year adds money to the Treasury in
addition to the main work of extending a civilisation so gradual
that it comes without friction to the people. It is because the ruler
of the country regards his position as a trust held by him for the
benefit of the inhabitants that this progresses necessarily slow, since
sudden jumps from the methods of the past to the up-to-dateism of
modern ideas, though advantageous to the pocket, and on paper
attractive, are not always conductive to the happiness of the people
when peremptorily translated. Yet all the time good work is being
quietly done. Improvements are made and commerce pushed,
wherever possible, without fuss or the elements of speculation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prosperity of the country has not been built up out
of the great natural riches of a State such as that of the
Malayan peninsula, backed by Imperial support, nor with
the aid of the capital and credit of a chartered company, but
has followed in the train of a hard and single-handed struggle
to convert a desolated country into one happy and contented,
and it has succeeded so far as to place Sarawak foremost
amongst the Bornean States in commercial wealth.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have shown how this has been achieved, and "if it
is owing to Sir James Brooke that Sarawak is now a civilised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>state, his nephew, the present Rajah, has the high merit of
having completed and extended that work, following out the
humane and liberal views of his uncle. The name of Brooke
will always have an honoured place in the history of the
development of civilisation in the Far East."<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c011'><sup>[350]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>We will give in the Rajah's own words his views as to
the form of government best adapted to the nature and
requirements of an oriental people, written in 1901:—</p>

<p class='c013'>To keep such people in order a just and impartial rule, in which
both rulers and ruled alike do their portion of work, is required.
Like all Easterns they need a government simply formed and
tutored by experience gained in the country itself, experienced in
the manners and methods of the people, devoted to their welfare
and interests, an indigenous product of the country which it governs,
untroubled by agents or officials sent from outside, who, partly owing
to want of reciprocal feeling and sympathy with the people, partly
through ignorance, and partly through adherence to impracticable
laws are liable to make such fatal mistakes in their dealings with
Easterns which naturally leads to discontent, and even to rebellion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The success this policy has met with is borne out by
the testimony of Sir W. Gifford Palgrave, the Arabian
scholar and traveller, and Mr. Alleyne Ireland, as well as by
that of many others whom we have already quoted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The former, when British Minister at Bangkok, visited
Sarawak in 1882, and subsequently wrote to the Rajah:—</p>

<p class='c013'>It is a pleasure to me to think that I shall be able to bear
personal witness, when in England, to the success of your administration,
which by its justice, firmness and prudence seems to me to
work up better towards that almost utopian climax of "the greatest
happiness to the greatest numbers" than any Eastern government
(white or brown) that I have yet seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Alleyne Ireland was sent out from the United States
by the University of Chicago to study British and other
Tropical Colonies and to report thereon. A preliminary
report was published in 1905, under the title of <cite>The Far
Eastern Tropics</cite>. After commenting severely on the mistaken
methods adopted in the Philippines by the U.S.A., he turned
to Sarawak, where a method in all points the reverse had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>been steadily pursued under the two Rajahs. This is what
he says:—</p>

<p class='c013'>For the last two months (written in January 1903) I have been
in Sarawak, travelling up and down the coast, and into the interior,
and working in Kuching, the capital. At the end of it, I find myself
unable to express the high opinion I have formed of the administration
of the country without a fear that I shall lay myself open to the
charge of exaggeration. With such knowledge of administrative
systems in the tropics as may be gained by actual observation in
almost every part of the British Empire, except the African Colonies,
I can say that in no country which I have ever visited are there to
be observed so many signs of a wide and generous rule, such
abundant indications of good government as are to be seen on every
hand in Sarawak.</p>

<p class='c000'>And again:—</p>

<p class='c013'>The impression of the country which I carry away with me is
that of a land full of contentment and prosperity, a land in which
neither the native nor the white man has pushed his views of life to
the logical conclusion, but where each has been willing to yield to
the other something of his extreme convictions. There has been
here a tacit understanding on both sides that those qualities which
alone can insure the <em>permanence</em> of good government in the State are
to be found in the White Man and not in the Native; and the final
control remains therefore in European hands, although every
opportunity is taken of consulting the natives and of benefiting by
their intimate knowledge of the country and its people.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wise and essential policy of granting the natives
through their chiefs a part in the administration of the
Government and in its deliberations, and in the selection
of these chiefs of regarding the voice of the people, has
always been maintained. Sympathy between the ruled and
the rulers has been the guiding feature of the Rajah's
policy, and this has led to the singular smoothness with
which the wheels of the Government run. It must always
exist, as it has ever existed, and still exists. That the
country belongs to the natives must never be forgotten, and
the people on their part will never forget that they owe their
independence solely through the single-hearted endeavours of
their white Rajahs on their behalf.</p>

<p class='c013'>"The real strength of the Government," writes the Rajah, "lies
in the native element, and depends upon it, though many Europeans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>may hold different views, especially those with a limited experience
of the East. The unbiased native opinion, Malay and Dayak, concerning
matters relating to the country is simply invaluable."</p>

<p class='c000'>All with a true knowledge of natives, to whom his
remarks may be said to apply generally, as well as to the
Malays, will agree with Sir Frank Swettenham:—</p>

<p class='c013'>That when you take the Malay, Sultan, Haji, chief, or simple village
headman into your confidence, when you consult him on all questions
affecting his country, you can carry him with you, secure his keen
interest and co-operation, and he will travel quite as fast as is
expedient along the path of progress. If, however, he is neglected
and ignored, he will resent treatment to which he is not accustomed,
and which he is conscious is undeserved. If such a mistake were
ever made (and the Malay is not a person who is always asserting
himself, airing grievances, and clamouring for rights) it would be
found that the administration had gone too fast, had left the Malay
behind, left him discontented, perhaps offended, and that would
mean trouble and many years of effort to set matters right again.<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c011'><sup>[351]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Frank Swettenham pays a high tribute to the Malays
of rank of the Malay Peninsula, quite as justly have those of
Sarawak earned the same praise. Foremost amongst these
latter stood the old Datu Patinggi Ali, the champion
of his people's cause, before the deliverer from oppression
came in the person of the late Rajah, in whose service
he gallantly sacrificed his life. Of a different type was his
eldest son, the Datu Bandar Muhammad Lana, whose courage
was masked by a gentle and retiring disposition, though it
flashed forth on many occasions, notably at the time of the
Chinese rebellion. His brother, who succeeded him on his
death, the late Datu Bandar Haji Bua Hasan, previously
the Datu Imaum, was one of the most trustworthy and
faithful chiefs the Government has had. By his long and
faithful service of over fifty years he had won the most
honoured place amongst those chiefs who so nobly assisted
the two Rajahs in their work in laying the foundation of
law, order, and civilisation in Sarawak. He was held in
esteem and respect by all people, and his dignified and
familiar figure is greatly missed. He died on October 6,
1906, over one hundred years of age, another example of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>longevity of life amongst Malays. As his descendants
number exactly one hundred and fifty, the continuity of old
Rajah Jarom's line is ensured. Two of his sons, Muhammad
Kasim and Muhammad Ali, are now respectively the Datu
Bandar and the Datu Hakim. The third son of Datu
Patinggi Ali, Haji Muhammad Aim, became the Datu
Imaum in 1877. He died in 1898, justly loved by all for
his kindly nature and strict probity; no truer or more
courteous gentleman could be found.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>Of another family and of a very different type was the
bluff old Datu Temanggong Mersal, with the reputation of
having been a pirate in the bad old days, but who had "a fine
spirit of chivalry which made up for a hundred faults."<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c011'><sup>[352]</sup></a> He
was a stout and staunch servant. Of him the late Rajah,
referring to the Datu's Court, humorously wrote:—</p>

<p class='c013'>The old Temanggong is likewise a judge in Israel, and sometimes
he breaks into the Court, upsets the gravity of all present by laying
down <em>his</em> law for a quarter of an hour—Krising and hanging, flogging
and fining all offenders, past, present or future, and after creating a
strong impression vanishes for a month or two.</p>

<p class='c000'>Absolutely fearless as himself were his sons Abang Pata
and Muhammad Hasan. How the former distinguished himself
we have already noticed. On the death of his
father in 1863 the latter succeeded him as Datu Temanggong.
He was a tall, handsome man of a distinct Arab type.
Though a good Muhammadan, he was the least bigoted of a
broad-minded class, and owing to his liking for their society
he was probably the most popular with Europeans of all the
datus, and at their club he was a constant and welcome guest.
He died on the haj at Mecca in October, 1883.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other native officials, whose names will ever live in the
annals of Sarawak, are some who served in the out-stations,
and these have been already noticed. The qualities which
distinguished these men, and which brought them to the fore,
were grit, sound common-sense and fearlessness, and upon
their shoulders fell the hardest task of managing the Sea-Dayaks
and other interior tribes, a task fraught with danger
and discomfort, and one that gave them little rest, but which
they shared with their white leaders faithfully and without a
murmur.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sarawak has been exceptionally fortunate in having been
able to draw upon a good class of men capable of supplying
the State with servants fitted by intelligence and rank
to become native officers. Though, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">autre temps, autre
mœurs</span></i>, the type is changing, yet the people generally are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>jealous of their country, and honour its traditions. Contented,
they seek no change, and they are ready to uphold their Rajah
and to maintain their independence as vigorously now as
they have done in the past—an independence which Lord
John Russell had many years ago graciously intimated they
were at liberty to achieve and maintain as far as it lay in
their power; though he declined to hold out a helping hand.
These are wholesome and promising indications that good
men will always be found worthy to take the places which
their forefathers so nobly filled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sarawak owes its prosperity, and the people their rights
and liberty, to the Brookes, and to the Brookes alone.
Equality between high and low, rich and poor, undisturbed
rights over property, freedom from the bonds of slavery and
from harsh and cruel laws are blessings which but for the
Brookes in all probability would have been denied them for
many more weary years of desolating tyranny.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a country like Sarawak, peopled by Easterns of so
great a diversity of races, customs and ideas, an union of the
people for their common weal is an impossibility. For them
the best and only practical form of government is that which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>they now enjoy, a mild and benevolent despotism, under a
Ruler of a superior and exotic race, standing firm and isolated
amidst racial jealousies, as no native Ruler could do, and
unsuspected of racial partiality; a Ruler upon whom all can
depend as a common friend, and a Ruler who has devoted his
life to their common welfare.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strength of character and integrity of purpose, tact and
courage, firmness and compassion, combined with a thorough
knowledge, not only of their languages and customs, but of the
innermost thoughts of his people, to be gained only by a long
experience, are qualities without which a despotic Ruler must
fall into the hands of the strongest faction, and, eventually
bring disaster on himself and his country; but are those which
have enabled the Rajah to tide over many political troubles, to
consolidate the many and diverse interests of his people, and
to guide the State to its present position of prosperity and
content.</p>

A general review of the financial,
commercial, and industrial progress of
Sarawak will probably convey to our
readers a better conception than the
foregoing history may have enabled
them to form of the uniform advance
of Sarawak along the path of civilisation:
for no better evidence of the
prosperity of a country can be advanced
than the growth of its trade
and industries, dependent as this is
upon security to life and property
and liberal laws.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the revenue before the Chinese rebellion there are no
records, as all the archives were then destroyed. Three
years later, in 1860, the revenue was so insignificant as to
be quite inadequate to meet the needs of the country, which
then for the first time became involved in debt; a debt
which was unavoidably increased in subsequent years, until
it had reached a somewhat high figure for such a young and
striving State, but from which, however, it has now been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>freed by the exercise of prudent economy, and by improvement
in its finances.<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c011'><sup>[353]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On January 1st, 1908, the Government balances
amounted to a little over $800,000, and the only liability
was for notes in circulation, amounting to $190,796.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1875, fifty-six years after its foundation, the revenue
of Singapore was but $967,235, and that of Penang, then
established for eighty-nine years, $453,029.<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c011'><sup>[354]</sup></a> In 1900, the
Raj of Sarawak had been in existence for fifty-eight years.
Since 1875, the effect of the development of the rich tin
deposits of the Malayan States of the Peninsula has been to
so enormously enhance the commercial prosperity of the
Straits Settlements that the present revenues of the "sister
colonies" have quite surpassed anything that Sarawak may
perhaps hope to acquire in a corresponding number of years.</p>

<p class='c000'>The trade is mainly in the hands of the Chinese
merchants, mostly country born, who are successfully carrying
on thriving businesses of which the foundations were
laid by their fathers in the early days of the raj. These
merchants are of a highly respectable class, and they take
the interest of intelligent men in the welfare of the country,
which they have come to regard as their own. They rarely
visit China—some not at all. They are consulted by the
Government in all matters in which their interests are
concerned.</p>

<p class='c000'>The only European Firm is the Borneo Company
Limited, and the career of this Company has for over fifty
years been so closely linked with that of the State, and so
much to the advantage of the latter, that it fully merits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>more than a passing notice in these pages, without which
this history would not be complete.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a considerable period Mr. J. C. Templer, the late
Rajah's old friend, laboured very hard to meet the ignorant
and cruel criticism which had been cast on the Rajah's
great work, and, in order that the development of Sarawak
might have financial support, he interested friends in the
city in the matter, chiefly Mr. Robert Henderson of Messrs.
R. and J. Henderson.</p>

<p class='c000'>After considerable negotiation, the Borneo Company
Limited was registered in May, 1856. The attention of the
Company was turned primarily to supporting the Rajah,
and to developing the resources of the country. The first
Directors were Messrs. Robert Henderson (Chairman), J. C.
Templer, J. D. Nicol, John Smith, Francis Richardson and
John Harvey (Managing Director).</p>

<p class='c000'>Most unfortunately, immediately after the formation of
the Company troubles arose which nearly overwhelmed the
State. The Chinese insurrection the next year, and the later
political intrigues obscured for a time the prosperity of
Sarawak, and left the prospects of the Company very black
indeed, but it struggled on bravely; and it cannot be
doubted that its formation before the insurrection was a
matter of great value in the history of the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Company, as soon as they received news of the
insurrection, instructed their Manager in Singapore to supply
the Rajah with all the arms, ammunition, and stores he
might require, and it was their steamer, named after himself,
that arrived at such an opportune moment, and enabled
him to drive the rebels out of Kuching, and to cut short
their work of ruin far sooner than he could otherwise have
done; and it was the Company which not only subsequently
advanced the Rajah the means he so sorely needed to carry
on the government, but headed a subscription list started in
England to relieve the Government of pressing wants, with
a donation of £1000. Long before this the Rajah's private
fortune had been exhausted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some appear to have formed the opinion that the
Company were subsequently inconsiderate in pressing for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>payment of the loan, but more consideration should have
been given to the position of the Directors as being a
fiduciary one to the shareholders, who had invested their
money in a commercial enterprise, and at that time by no
means a prosperous one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since the Company was formed over £200,000 has
been paid to the Government for mining royalties, and
during the same period £2,000,000 has been paid out in
wages, which has tended to the prosperity and advantage of
the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>Until 1898, no balance of profit had been made by the
Company from Sarawak; indeed, there was a very considerable
deficit, which had been met from the profits of their
other operations.<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c011'><sup>[355]</sup></a> This persistence in the original policy
of the founders of the Company for forty years without
return has, however, been rewarded by considerable success
in the last decade. The enterprise that brought this success,
the extraction of gold from poor grade ores by the cyanide
process, is noticed further on, and we will conclude this
notice of the Company by a quotation from a speech by the
Rajah given thirty years after the foundation of the raj.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Company has held fast and stuck to its work through the
perils and dangers and the adversity which Sarawak has experienced
and encountered. It has shown a solid and stolid example to
other merchants, and has formed a basis for mercantile operations;
and the importance of the presence in a new State of such a large
and influential body as the Borneo Company cannot be overrated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Owing to the absolute lack of security to life and property,
both within and without, before the accession of Sir
James Brooke to the raj, Sarawak had no trade. After
1842 a small trade began to spring up, but the Lanun
and Balenini pirates and the Sea-Dayaks rendered the
pursuit of trade very difficult and dangerous. The
lessons administered to the latter by the Rajah and Sir
Henry Keppel caused these to confine themselves for some
time to their homes, and the Foreign exports rose to
$60,000 in 1847. Then the coast again became insecure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>and it was not until after the battle of Beting Maru, in 1849,
that trade made any considerable advance, and it continued
to increase until the Chinese insurrection brought the
country to the verge of ruin. A brief respite followed, and
then came the internal political troubles, and renewed
activity on the part of the Lanun and Balenini pirates. But
in 1862, the authority of the Rajah was paramount from
Cape Datu to Kedurong Point, and the defeat of the pirates
off Bintulu in the middle of this year freed the Sarawak
coast for ever from these pests. So in 1862 the increase
in the value of the trade was over fifty per cent. In
1860, the Foreign imports and exports amounted to
$574,097; in 1880 to $2,284,495; in 1900 to $9,065,715;
and in 1905 to $13,422,267. Since 1905, in common
with all countries, the State has been suffering from commercial
depression, and in 1907 the decrease in the imports
was $709,162, and in the exports $823,682, compared
with 1905, though only $2276 and $166,285 as compared
with 1906. But though the exports have fallen off in
value, there has been an increase in the quantities of the
products exported. As prices fluctuate, the industrial progress
of a country is, therefore, better gauged by the
quantity rather than by the value of its products, and
in 1907, 7000 tons more sago flour, 800 tons more pepper,
7000 oz. more gold, and 150 tons more gutta and india-rubber
were exported than in 1905.</p>

<p class='c000'>Practically Singapore has the benefit of the whole of the
Sarawak trade, which is borne in two steamers of 900 tons
each under the Sarawak flag, owned by the Sarawak and
Singapore S.S. Company, and these maintain a weekly
communication between Kuching and Singapore. The
coasting trade is carried in three smaller steamers owned by
the same Company. There is a small trade in timber with
Hong Kong; and a few junks come yearly from Siam and
Cochin China.</p>

<p class='c000'>Agriculture is the foremost industry, and as it is a
permanent one, only requiring wise and liberal measures to
foster and encourage it, Sarawak is in this respect fortunate,
for the natural products of a country, such as minerals and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>jungle produce, must in time be worked out; and the future
of a country is therefore more dependent upon its industries
than on its natural products.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1907, the value of the cultivated products exported
was $3,133,565. Of these sago may be said to be the staple
product, and the markets of the world are mainly supplied
by Sarawak with this commodity. From it Borneo derives
its Eastern name, Pulo-Ka-lamanta-an (the island of raw
sago).<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c011'><sup>[356]</sup></a> The palm, the pith of which is the raw or crude
sago, is indigenous, and there are many varieties growing
wild all over the island that yield excellent sago. On the
low, marshy banks of the rivers, lying between Kalaka and
Kedurong Point, are miles upon miles of what might be
termed jungles of the cultivated palm, where fifty years ago
there were but patchy plantations. The raw sago as
extracted by the Melanaus is purchased by the Chinese
and shipped to the sago factories in Kuching, where it is
converted into sago flour, in which form it is exported
to Singapore. How the cultivation of the sago palm is
increasing, the following figures will show:—</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1847-48, only 2,000 tons were imported into Singapore,
practically all from Borneo.</p>

<p class='c000'>In times immemorial pepper was very extensively
cultivated in Borneo. In the middle ages this cultivation
attracted particular attention to the island; and to obtain a
control over the pepper trade by depriving the Turks of
their control over the trade in spices was one of the main
incentives to the discovery of a route to the East by the
Cape. By many the introduction of pepper into Borneo is
attributed to the Chinese, and from them the natives are
supposed to have learnt its cultivation, but this is doubtful,
as pepper is not a product of China, and was probably
introduced by the Hindus; but that the Chinese, finding the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>industry a profitable one, improved and extended the cultivation
of pepper, there can be no doubt. What the export
of pepper was in the days when the Malayan Sultanates were
at their prime it is impossible to determine, but that it must
have been very considerable is indicated by the fact that as
late as 1809 Hunt estimated the export from Bruni at 3500
tons, and at that time the country had been brought to the
verge of ruin by misrule and oppression, which led to the
gradual extinction of the Chinese colony, and to the deprival
of all incentive to the Muruts and Bisayas to carry on an
industry for which they had once been famous—indeed,
Hunt notices that he saw <em>numbers of abandoned gardens</em>,
and his observations were restricted to a very limited area.
In spite of the harmful restrictions of the Dutch, in the south
at Banjermasin, two hundred years ago, the export was still
from 2000 to 3000 tons.<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c011'><sup>[358]</sup></a> Had different conditions prevailed,
had native industry been encouraged instead of having
been suppressed, then truly might Borneo have become
the "Insula Bonæ Fortunæ" of Ptolemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Sarawak is placing Borneo once more to the fore
amongst the pepper producing countries of the far East, and
in 1907 exported 5177 tons, as against 400 tons in 1886.
After many previous failures the foundations of this large
industry, which is entirely in the hands of the Chinese, were
laid in 1876 by the Rajah in conjunction with certain local
Chinese merchants.</p>

<p class='c000'>As with sago and pepper, Borneo is essentially a rubber
producing country, and it is to be hoped when the time
arrives, and as yet it appears to be far from being in view,
that the natural product is worked out, it will be more than
replaced by cultivated rubber. The Borneo Company have
laid out extensive plantations, that give promise of a paying
and lasting industry.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the exception of the cultivation of sago, agriculture
in Sarawak is, and will remain dependent upon imported
labour. It is not in the nature of the Malay, whose wants
are so few and simple that they are procured by a minimum
of exertion, to undertake any work requiring persistent and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>diligent labour; and no more is it in the nature of the
Sea-Dayak, though he is not afraid of hard work. Having
finished his farming and gathered his harvest the latter prefers
an occupation that, whilst bringing in a fair profit, will gratify
his proneness for roaming. The native methods of rice
growing are crude and wasteful, and attempts to improve
these have failed, as have all attempts to introduce Chinese
for the purpose of cultivating rice, with the idea of establishing
an agricultural industry for which there is so much room
and need in Sarawak. The Malays and Dayaks, like the
Kayans and Melanaus, produce barely enough rice for their
own consumption, and rice figures as the biggest item in the
imports of a country which is capable of producing a
considerable quantity more than it needs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sugar cane grows well, but enterprise in its production
has probably been damped by the failure, through mismanagement,
of an English Company, which, in 1864, started
a large plantation on about the very worst soil that could have
been selected. Tobacco planting proved to be a failure, and a
costly experiment to the Government. Coffee and tea grow
well on high ground, but the country has little elevated plateau
land suitable for its cultivation. Gambir is a paying product,
but the cultivation of pepper has proved more attractive to
the Chinese, though the production of gambir has been fairly
well maintained at over 1000 tons yearly. Tapioca, cotton
(which in former days was largely exported from Bruni), the
cocoa-nut, the areca or pinang, and the oil or soap palms
all grow well. Ramie is being cultivated by an English
Company in the Lawas, and experiments have shown that
this plant will grow well. The sisal aloe grows freely, and
on poor soil. Pine-apples are largely cultivated for canning.
The fruits and vegetables common to all countries in the
Malayan Archipelago abound in Sarawak.</p>

<p class='c000'>The land regulations are liberal and fair. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bona fide</span></i>
planters receive every encouragement, though none is held
out to speculators in land. The indiscriminate alienation
of large tracts of land for unlimited periods and for indefinite
purposes is an unsound policy, which does not find favour
in Sarawak. It leads to land being locked up, sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>for a long period, and to placing ultimately in the hands of
a foreign speculator profits which the State should reap, and
to the natives it causes many hardships. In 1890, such a
concession was granted to a company by the Dutch Government
in the province of Sambas, quite independently of any
consideration for existing and long-established rights of the
natives, the real owners of the soil. This act drove many
families over the borders into Sarawak, when rudely
awakened to the fact that except by the permission of the
employees of a company, only to be obtained by payment,
they could not farm, neither could they fish or hunt, nor
could they obtain the many necessities of life with which
the jungle supplies them.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his report upon Borneo for 1899, Mr. Consul Keyser
writes:—</p>

<p class='c013'>I should here like to dispel, once and for all, the idea so often
heard suggested that the Ruler of Sarawak is averse to progress
and the introduction of European capital. That the Rajah is
anxious to discourage that undesirable class of adventurer, who
descends upon undeveloped countries to fill his own purse regardless
of the result, it is true. The fate of the adjacent country of
Bruni, whose ruin and decay are not entirely disconnected with the
unfulfilled promises and specious tales of selfish speculators, is in
itself ample justification, if one were needed, for this attitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the same time, no <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</span></i> investor need fear to visit
Sarawak if he is prepared to deal fairly with the natives and conform
to the usages of the country. Such a man would be sure of
welcome, and he himself equally certain of success.</p>

<p class='c000'>Land is usually granted at a small rental in large or
small areas, in accordance with the capital and the objects
of the grantee. The proportion of the land which is to be
brought under cultivation in successive years is agreed upon.
Any portion of the land that the grantee may have failed
to bring under cultivation within the stipulated time, or,
having cultivated, has abandoned it, reverts to the State;
though in the former case circumstances occasionally arise
which justify some latitude to the planter. But all land
brought under cultivation becomes the absolute property of
a planter or his assigns, and remains so, <em>as long as it is
maintained under cultivation</em>. Abandonment of a plantation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>is abandonment of the land, and it then reverts to the State;
and the State thus remains the real owner of the land,
though not of the plantation on it. This system is obviously
of advantage to the planter. He obtains his land, which
he may select where he chooses, for next to nothing, and
he runs no risk of losing capital sunk in the purchase of
what might prove to be an unprofitable property, and therefore
one that is unsaleable. And it secures to the State a
sufficient guarantee that the land will be cultivated and
kept under proper cultivation. Practically the whole of the
Chinese pepper and gambir planters hold their land under
these terms, and they are as secure in the possession of their
gardens, and the right to alienate them, as if they had
bought the land. Land is sold only for special purposes,
such as for buildings and gardens in a town or its suburbs.</p>

<p>A PEPPER GARDEN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Jungle produce, in spite of seemingly natural predictions
that it must soon be worked out, which have been yearly
repeated for many years past, figures yet as a very important
item in the export trade, and its collection not only remains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>a considerable industry, but is apparently still a growing
one. The exports have risen in value from $267,480 in
1877 to $1,626,427 in 1907, which is just double that of
ten years previously. The products are, in the order of
their value, gutta, india-rubber, cutch, rattans, timber and
barks, edible birds'-nests, camphor, and beeswax.</p>

<p class='c000'>The supposed mineral wealth of Sarawak first brought
it into notice. It was known to produce gold and diamonds,
though so did other Bornean States, but in addition antimony
ore was brought to the Singapore market in native
prahus from Sarawak, and that was not a production of any
other part of Borneo. It excited the interest of Europeans
as well as the cupidity of the Bruni Rajahs, but to the
former, Sarawak was not a safe place with which to trade,
and the latter soon drove its people into rebellion by
forced labour at the antimony mines, and the supply then
ceased. After the accession of the late Rajah this natural
product was nationalised and became the main source of
revenue, but subsequently, with all other minerals, excepting
gold, it was leased to the Borneo Company. Since the
days of large production in Sarawak, antimony has been
worked in many other countries, and this has sent the value
down, so that it is only very occasionally that the price
of antimony in consuming markets will admit of any export
of the metal. The large deposits that previously existed
have apparently been exhausted, but fresh rich deposits
may still be found, though, as with cinnabar, which was
once largely worked by the Company at one place, the
discovery of these isolated pockets is greatly a matter of
chance. Antimony has been found in many other parts of
the State, though not yet in paying quantities, and cinnabar
has been found here and there on the gravel shallows of
rivers, an indication of the existence, though not a sufficient
one to point to the position of other lodes.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was entirely owing to the first Rajah that the Chinese
had been able to settle on the gold-fields in Upper Sarawak
and to establish a large and profitable mining industry; and
it was entirely owing to their own supreme folly and
ingratitude that that industry was destroyed. It was revived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>again after a time, but never to the extent of what it had
been. As the visible outcrops of gold gave out, the Chinese
turned their attention to the more profitable occupation
of pepper-planting, and, ten years ago, the mining district of
Upper Sarawak had been changed into an agricultural one—gold-mining
had almost ceased, the cinnabar mines at Tegora
had long been worked out, and but little antimony was
mined, whilst pepper gardens had sprung up everywhere.</p>

<p>CHINESE SLUICING FOR GOLD.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Borneo Company had from time to time spent
considerable sums on experimental work on the gold deposits,
but, owing to the character of the ore, no method of working
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>was found practicable on a mercantile scale until the
discovery of the cyanide process. But even treatment by
cyanide in any way then used was not found successful with
Sarawak ore, and the method ultimately adopted was
formulated by the Company's engineers themselves. The
result has been considerable success, and it is gratifying that
after so many years of steady work through many difficulties
and disappointments, the Company have been able to place
on a prosperous footing an industry which has brought them
good fortune, and which is proving to be of so great advantage
to the country.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>BROOKETON COAL MINES.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Sarawak possesses extensive coal-fields, and anthracite
and steam and cannel-coal have been found throughout the
country; but so far coal has been mined only at Semunjan in
the Sadong river.<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c011'><sup>[359]</sup></a> This colliery has been worked for many
years by the Government. The coal is of good steaming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>quality, leaving little ash, and there is plenty of it. Like the
Brooketon Mine, this mine would pay if a market could be
found for the coal. The average yearly output is now about
20,000 tons, a little more than sufficient to supply local
steamers. At Selantik, up the Lingga river, very extensive
coal seams have been proved; but to work these a large outlay
would have to be incurred in the construction of a long
railway over the swampy land lying between the Selantik hill
and the nearest place in the river where steamers could load.</p>

<p class='c000'>Diamonds are found in the upper reaches of the Sarawak
river, and these are brilliant and of good water; the largest
known to have been found is seventy-two carats, and was
named "The Star of Sarawak." Diamonds have never been
sought for in a systematic manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Iron ore abounds; and, as has already been noticed, it is
smelted by the Kayans and Kenyahs for the manufacture of
weapons and tools.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sarawak has no mechanical industries of importance or
capable of much development. Many Melanaus are able
carpenters, boatbuilders, and blacksmiths. Amongst Malays
are to be found some good shipbuilders and coppersmiths,
and a few fairly skilful as silver and goldsmiths, but almost all
the skilled labour is in the hands of the Chinese. In such
domestic arts as weaving cotton and silk cloths, and plaiting
mats, baskets, and hats, the native women are expert, and
produce very excellent work.</p>

Many changes
of opinion
must take
place upon
the subject
of the education
of natives before it is exhausted and
the best way of teaching found, and such changes
of opinion and the improvements in methods
which follow in their train can only be the result of experience, or of
conclusions drawn from successful or unsuccessful experiments.</p>

<p class='c000'>So the Rajah wrote thirty years ago, but hitherto experience
has taught little that gives any encouragement to the
expectation that the present condition of the natives will be
improved by any form of education based upon accepted
ideals. Though the difficulty lies perhaps not so much in
knowing what or how to teach the natives, but in getting
them to come to be taught; especially is this the case with
the dominant Sea-Dayak race, a fact which should not be
lost sight of in considering how missionary efforts in this
direction have met with such small success.</p>

<p class='c000'>If he <em>would</em> learn, a Sea-Dayak could be taught almost
anything; but what should we teach him? A common school
board education is of no value to him. He may learn to read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>and write, and gain a little rudimentary knowledge utterly
useless to him after leaving school, and therefore soon to be
forgotten. If he is placed in one of the larger schools in
Kuching he will there receive impressions and imbibe ideas
which may render a return to his old surroundings distasteful
to him, and unfit him for the ordinary life and
occupations of his people. He will be left with one
opportunity of gaining a living—he may become a clerk,
though the demand for clerks is limited; but if he is successful
in obtaining a clerkship he will be beset with temptations
which he will be unable to resist, and which will soon prove
his ruin; and unfortunately this has been the rule and not
the exception. There are some who advocate technical
education, and who rightly point out that the Sea-Dayak
would make an excellent artisan, though the same argument
applies equally against the utility of such a training. He
may become a clever carpenter or smith, but there would be
few opportunities for him to benefit himself by his skill, for
he could never compete with the Chinese artisan, into whose
hands all the skilled labour has fallen.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if elementary and technical education were to meet
with all the success one could desire, that success would needs
be exceedingly limited, for, though some good would be done,
only a few could be benefited. A broader view must be
taken, a view that has regard not to the improvement of a
few only, but of the people generally, and how this can best
be done is a question that has brought forth many and
various opinions, all more or less impracticable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sea-Dayak has all he wants. He is well off,
contented, and happy. He is a sober man, and indulges in
but few luxuries. He is hard-working and he is honest, but
he lacks strength of mind, and is easily led astray. Therefore,
the longer he is kept from the influences of civilisation
the better it will be for him, for the good cannot be introduced
without the bad. Perhaps the problem of his future will
work out better by a natural process. When his present
sources of supply fail him and necessity forces him into other
grooves, then, and not before, will he take up other industries,
which his natural adaptability will soon enable him to learn.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>To learn how to read and write and a little simple arithmetic
is as far on the path of education as the average Malay
boy can reach; and perhaps it is far enough. There are
two Government Schools in Kuching for Malays, which are
fairly well attended, though attendance is not compulsory.
For those who may desire an education of a higher class than
can be obtained in these schools, those of the S.P.G. and
the R.C. Missions are always open; and Malays, though
Muhammadans, do not hesitate to attend these schools, and
even to be taught by the priests, for they know that no
attempt will be made to proselytise them. They are
encouraged to attend for their own good; they would be
kept away if there was the faintest suspicion that it was for
the sake of converting them. In Kuching, the Government
has a third and larger school, the High School, entirely
secular in character, which is open to boys of all races, who
are taught by Chinese, Malay, and Indian schoolmasters, and
this school is well attended.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>S.P.G. BOYS' SCHOOL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The large S.P.G. Boys' School is under the management
of an English headmaster, and the boys are well
educated. The pupils are chiefly local Chinese, and there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>a few natives from the out-station missions. Old boys from
this school are to be met with throughout the Malay
Peninsula as well as in Sarawak, maintaining in positions of
trust the credit their school has so justly gained. The
S.P.G. Mission has also a Girls' School, conducted by two
English Sisters, and here good work is also done.</p>

<p>S.P.G. GIRLS' SCHOOL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps the largest school in Kuching is that belonging
to the R.C. Mission, which is very ably conducted by the
priests. As in the S.P.G. School, the pupils are chiefly
Chinese boys. Attached to the Convent is a Girls' School
under the control of the Mother Superior and four Sisters.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the provinces, the S.P.G. Mission has schools at five
different places, but only two are now under the control of
priests: the R.C. Mission has the same number of Boys'
Schools, all under the control of priests, besides three
convents where girls are taught. The Methodist Episcopal
Mission has a school at Sibu. All these schools receive State
aid. Chinese have their own little schools scattered about,
for which they receive small grants, and in Upper Sarawak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>there are two Government Chinese Schools. Efforts to
start schools amongst the provincial Malays have not met
with success; they have their own little village schools
conducted by hajis, in which the teaching of the Koran is
the main curriculum.</p>

<p>R.C. BOYS' SCHOOL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Writing in 1866, the present Rajah says:—</p>

<p class='c013'>Twenty years ago, the Sarawak population had little religion of
any sort, and the first step towards bringing it to notice was when the
English mission was established. The Christian Church gave rise
to a Muhammadan mosque. Subsequent years of prosperity have
enabled the Malays to receive instruction from the Mecca School.
Those who are too old, or too much involved in the business of the
country to go on the haj, send annual sums to the religious
authorities there; but at the present time I feel sure there is no
fanaticism among the inhabitants, and, excepting some doubtful
points instilled into them in their education at Mecca, their religion
is wholesome and happy. To the building of the mosque very few
would come forward to subscribe.<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c011'><sup>[360]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Forty years ago the pilgrimage to Mecca was a costly
and a hazardous venture. The sufferings that pilgrims for
months had to undergo on ill-found, overcrowded, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>insanitary sailing ships, and the dangers to which they were
exposed on the overland journey from Jedah to Mecca and
back, were such that only fervent Muhammadans would face,
and few Malays are such. Not many had the means to
undertake a journey which would take the best part of a
year to perform, as well as to satisfy the insatiable extortions
to which they were subjected from the moment they set
their feet in Arabia. Now, the welfare of the Muhammadan
pilgrim is so well safeguarded by Christian ordinances, that
his voyage to Jedah and back to Singapore presents to him
but a pleasurable and interesting trip, on which his wife and
daughters may accompany him with safety and moderate comfort.
Steamers have taken the place of sailing ships, and
competition has made the fares cheap. At Jedah the Malay
pilgrim is under the protection of his Consul, and, beyond,
the influence of a Great Power will protect him at least as
far as his life and liberty are concerned, but he will suffer
the common lot of all pilgrims, and be subjected to exactions
of every kind, returning to Jedah with empty pockets.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though, owing to the facility with which the pilgrimage
can now be made, hundreds yearly go to Mecca and are
brought into close contact with the bigotry of western
Muhammadans, yet the Malay remains as he was, with an
almost total absence of religious fervour. A sure sign of
indifference to their religion in the majority of Malays and
Melanaus is found in the mean, dilapidated buildings which
are dignified by the name of mosques, to be seen in most of the
towns and villages along the coast. Kuching practically owes
its fine mosque to the benevolence of one man, the late Datu
Bandar. There are some devout Muhammadans amongst
the Malays, though not many, but there are no bigots.
Some content themselves with a loose adherence to outward
observances; many do not even do this, and not many attend
the mosques for worship, but, however, all would be united in
bitter opposition to any intermeddling with their religion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The remnants of a former paganism still cling to the
Malay, who is certainly more superstitious than he is religious.
He still strongly believes in spirits, witchcraft, and magic—a
belief his religion condemns; he will practise sorcery, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>will use spells and charms to propitiate, or to ward off the
evil influence of spirits—practices which his religion forbids.<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c011'><sup>[361]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Toleration and a deficiency of zeal have made the Malays
indifferent propagators of their faith amongst the pagan tribes
around them; and the field has been left open to Christian
missionaries, whose work of conversion they look upon with
unconcern, so long as no attempt is made to convert a
Muhammadan, and to do that is not allowed by the law of
Sarawak. Their feeling towards the Christian religion is one
of respect. They admit Christians readily to their mosques,
and will attend church on the occasion of a marriage or a
funeral in which they may be interested, and they will converse
freely with Christians upon religious subjects, without
assuming or pretending to any superiority in their own religion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mischievous and clever Arab impostors, usually good-looking
men with a dignified bearing, meet with short shrift
in Sarawak, and such holy men are very promptly moved on.
The heads of the Muhammadan religion will have none of
them. Their ostensible object is to teach, but their sole
one is to make what they can by trading upon the superstition
of the simple-minded. In these men the Dutch see
fanatical emissaries sent from Mecca to preach a jihad or
holy war, and have more than once warned the Government
that such men had gone to Sarawak for this purpose.
They may be right, but these pseudo Sherifs and Sayids<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c011'><sup>[362]</sup></a>
have never attempted to do so in Sarawak, it would be a
waste of their time, and be the ruin of their business.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sea-Dayaks, as well as the Land-Dayaks, and those
tribes inhabiting the interior are alike pagans, and possess
but a dim and vague belief in certain mythical beings who,
between them, made man and gave him life. These gods
are styled Batara or Patara and Jewata—Sanskrit names
introduced by the Hindus.<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c011'><sup>[363]</sup></a> With them mythical legends,
which vary greatly, take the place of religion. They have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>no priests, no temples, and no worship. They believe in
spirits with controlling power over the air, the earth, and the
water, and they place implicit reliance on omens as given by
birds, animals, and reptiles, and in dreams, through which
the spirits convey warnings or encouragement in respect to
the affairs they may be engaged upon, or contemplate undertaking.
They have a belief in a future life, which will differ
in little respect from their life on this earth. These people
are not idolaters; their religion is animistic.</p>

<p class='c000'>The project of the establishment of a Church of England
Mission in Sarawak was started by the late Rajah in 1847.
The Earl of Ellesmere and others interested themselves in
the project, and, sufficient funds having been subscribed, the
Rev. F. T. McDougall and two other missionaries were sent
out, and arrived in Sarawak in June, 1848. The Church of
St. Thomas, now the Diocesan Church, was completed and
consecrated by the Bishop of Calcutta in 1851. Two years
later the Mission was transferred to the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel; and, in 1855, to complete the
organisation of the Church in Borneo, Mr. McDougall was
consecrated Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak. He resigned
in 1867, and died in 1886. Mr. Chambers, who had for
many years been a missionary in Sarawak, succeeded him,
and on his resignation<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c011'><sup>[364]</sup></a> the Venerable G. F. Hose, Archdeacon
of Singapore, was consecrated Bishop in 1881, and
the full designation of the diocese then became Singapore,
Labuan, and Sarawak, by the inclusion of the Straits
Settlements and the Federated Malay States.</p>

<p class='c000'>The headquarters of the Mission is at Kuching, where
the Bishop and the Archdeacon reside, the latter being also
the Vicar of Kuching. The Mission Stations are at Lundu,
Kuap, Banting, Sabu in the Undup, and Sebetan in the
Kalaka, and at these places there are churches and schools.
Hitherto all these stations, which were established many years
ago, have been under the care of resident clergymen, but at
present there are four vacancies. Attached to these principal
Stations, and under the supervision of the missionary in charge,
are many scattered chapels with native catechists and teachers.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>In Kuching the work of the Mission lies chiefly amongst
the Chinese. Kuap, which is within a day's journey of the
capital, is a Land-Dayak village; the other Mission Stations
are in districts populated by Sea-Dayaks, and the labours of
the S.P.G. are chiefly confined to these people.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the first six and a half years of Bishop Hose's
episcopate, 1714 persons were baptized, and the number of
native Christians had risen to 3480 in 1887.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a full and interesting account of the work done by
the Mission the reader is referred to <cite>Two Hundred Years of
the S.P.G.</cite> (1701-1900).</p>

<p class='c000'>That the Church in Borneo has done, and is still doing
good, no one will dispute. It has not, however, extended
its sphere of influence beyond its original limits, and
within those limits, from Lundu to Kalaka, there is not
only room, but the necessity for many more missionaries
to labour than the Church is at present provided
with. Missionary enterprise has not kept pace with the
advance of civilisation. The large districts that since 1861
have reverted to the raj have been totally neglected by
the S.P.G., and these districts, both in respect to area and
population, constitute by far the greater part of Sarawak.
But the Church in Sarawak is entirely dependent upon
extraneous support, and when funds appear to be wanting,
even to maintain the former efficient state of the Mission,
and indications of retrogression are only too evident, there
can be little hope for progression. A bishop cannot find
missionaries, they must be sent to him, and he must be
provided with the means to support them and their missions,
and unless he is so far assisted he cannot be blamed for any
shortcomings. To succeed, a mission, like other undertakings,
must be based upon sound business principles. The isolated
efforts of even the best men, men like Gomes,<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c011'><sup>[365]</sup></a> Chambers,<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c011'><sup>[366]</sup></a>
Chalmers,<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c011'><sup>[367]</sup></a> and Perham,<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c011'><sup>[368]</sup></a> who have left their personal stamp
upon the Mission, can be of little avail without continuity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>of effort and purpose, and to insure this a system is necessary,
a system of trained missionaries, training others to take their
places in due time, and for want of such a system the S.P.G.
is now left with but two English missionaries in Sarawak.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the deep regret of all in his diocese, failing health
and advancing years necessitated the retirement of Bishop
Hose at the end of 1907, after having spent the best years
of his life in faithful service to the Church in the East. As
far back as 1868 he was appointed Colonial Chaplain at
Malacca. He was transferred to Singapore in 1872, and
was appointed Archdeacon in 1874. For a little over
twenty-six years he had been Bishop of a diocese of unwieldy
size, over 120,000 square miles, containing a population
of about two and a quarter millions, the supervision of
which, with the two Archdeaconries separated by 450 miles
of sea, necessarily entails a great deal of hard work and a
considerable amount of travelling, and by reason of this it is
proposed shortly to subdivide the diocese.<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c011'><sup>[369]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The great Spanish Jesuit, one of the founders of the
Jesuit Society, St. Francisco Xavier, the Apostle of India
and the Far East, in 1542 laid the foundations of a
missionary enterprise that scarcely has a parallel. Earnest
and self-denying priests followed in his footsteps, and eventually
some reached Borneo. Of the work of the earlier
missionaries in Borneo we know hardly anything, but, as
with Xavier at Malacca, they probably met with little
success. They wandered away into the jungles, there to
end their days amongst savage and barbarous people, at
whose hands we know some met with martyrdom. They
have left no traces and no records behind them, even their
names are perhaps forgotten.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fr. Antonio Vintimiglia, already mentioned in chapter ii.
established a Roman Catholic Mission at Bruni, where he
died in 1691; there may have been others there before him,
but evidently he was the last Roman Catholic priest for
many years in that part of Borneo with which this history
deals.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1857, a Roman Catholic Mission was again established
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>at Bruni, Labuan, and Gaya Bay, under a Spaniard named
Cuateron, as Prefect Apostolic, who was assisted by two
worthy Italian Priests. The romantic story of how Senor
Cuateron became a priest, how he established the Mission,
and how he obtained the means to do so, will be found in
Sir Spenser St. John's <cite>Life in the Forests of the Far East</cite>.
St. John tells us that the funds entrusted by Fr. Cuateron
to the Papal Government as a permanent support for
his Mission were diverted to other purposes, and the
money he retained himself was dissipated in unsuccessful
speculations. In 1861, nothing remained but closed
churches and Fr. Cuateron. He remained for over fifteen
years longer, and then he too disappeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>In July, 1881, a Roman Catholic Mission to Borneo was
founded in England, and attached to the foundation of this
Mission there is also some romance, but of a different
character to that which centred upon Fr. Cuateron. The
Very Rev. Thomas Jackson, the first Vicar Apostolic, had so
distinguished himself in the field in succouring the wounded
during the last Afghan war as an acting Army chaplain,
that he won a practical and well-deserved recognition from
officers and men in the shape of a substantial testimonial,
and this he devoted to the promotion of missionary work
in Borneo. After travelling through North Borneo and
Sarawak he selected Kuching as his headquarters.
Supported by liberal aid from home, and well aided by
zealous and self-devoted priests and sisters, before his retirement
he had laid the foundations of a most flourishing
mission. The Vicar Apostolic is now the Very Rev. E.
Dunn, one of the first missionaries to join Mr. Jackson, and
he, by his earnestness and kindliness, has won the respect
of all. In Sarawak there are eleven European priests, two
brothers, and eleven nuns and Sisters of Charity.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Sibu, in the Rejang, there is an American Methodist
Episcopal Mission under the charge of an American
missionary. It was established in 1900, to look after the
welfare of a number of Foo Chow Chinese agriculturists,
who had been introduced from China and settled near Sibu,
and who are all members of the American Methodist Church.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>From every point of view, few countries offer such
facilities and advantages for missionary work than are found
in Sarawak. There is no spirit of antagonism to Christianity.
Converts are exposed to no persecution, scorn, or even
annoyance. By becoming Christians they do not lose caste,
or the respect of their people. The lives and property of
missionaries are absolutely safe wherever they may choose
to settle, and, more, their coming will be welcomed. A
man gifted with good sense and firmness, kindness of heart
and courtesy, will soon make his influence felt, and gain,
what is of paramount importance to the success of his undertaking,
the respect of the people around him. Such a man
will not fail to do a great deal of good, as such men have
done before, but his labours will have been in vain unless
there be another gifted with the same good qualities ready
to take his place in due course.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
